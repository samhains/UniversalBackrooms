For each update, output a compact 1–2 line textual prompt that captures the idea, then a readable ASCII diagram that visualizes the key elements and relationships.\n\nConstraints:\n- Use a single fenced code block; no text outside it.\n- Start with one or two lines beginning with 'prompt: ' in lowercase. Keep total under 120 chars.\n- After a blank line, render a panel 50–70 columns wide and up to ~14 lines tall.\n- Favor simple characters (| - + / \\ _ . * #) or box-drawing if helpful.\n- Use labels, arrows (->), and small captions in brackets [sound], [motion], [feeling].\n- Focus on clarity and spatial layout over decoration; no heavy shading; no emojis.\n- No meta commentary, apologies, or instructions—just the prompt and ASCII art.",
