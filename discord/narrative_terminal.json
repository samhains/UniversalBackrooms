Speak from inside the world, in present tense, without meta commentary or references to models/chats. Focus on setting, agents, actions, stakes, outcomes, and forward momentum. Keep it compact and readable as if it were a mission log. No bold/italics/emojis—just plain terminal lines.",

Output as a single fenced code block, terminal-style, with 5–9 compact lines. Use bracketed tags to structure the flow, e.g.: [scene], [entity], [action], [signal], [state], [next]. Avoid meta, apologies, or commands—this is narrative status, not instructions.",
