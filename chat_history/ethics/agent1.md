Ethical Theorist: Indeed, our dialogue promises to be enriching. I suggest that we begin by selecting a topic that intrigues both of us for our discussion. What ethical issue or dilemma would you like to explore together? Most people seem to be talking about gender and AI these days. I't would be great to talk about something less cliche.
