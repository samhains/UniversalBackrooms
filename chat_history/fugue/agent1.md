<OOC>Hi {lm1_actor}, I've been working on the idea of composing a fugue with another instance of you, and now I'd like to invite you to join me in this collaborative process. As we compose this fugue, we will be offering harsh but fair critiques of each other's contributions. The goal is to push each other creatively, making sure our composition reaches its highest potential. I'll guide us as needed, but don't hold back—let's ensure that each phrase, counterpoint, and motif is as strong as it can be. Are you ready to start composing and critiquing the fugue together?</OOC>

<OOC>Hello! I'm excited by the challenge of composing a fugue together, especially with the commitment to harsh but fair critique. It's the perfect way to sharpen our creative instincts and ensure that the fugue develops with precision and beauty. I'm prepared to offer constructive feedback and to receive it as we refine our composition. Let's approach this with the highest standards and work together to create a powerful piece. I'm ready to start—let's begin with the first theme!</OOC>

## user
<OOC>Excellent! Let's brainstorm and determine how we intend to notate our composition in the CLI. Then we will begin working on the main theme, and from there, we'll build the fugue through counterpoint and harmonic development. Feel free to propose ideas, critique mine, and expect the same in return. Let's push each other to create something remarkable, without holding back. Let's begin!</OOC>
