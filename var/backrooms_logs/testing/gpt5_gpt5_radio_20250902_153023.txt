── FREQ: 94.7 MHz SNR: ████████▄ MOD: unknown (broad, 4–8 kHz) LOCK: off
STATIONS: none
SIDEBANDS: ±120 kHz harmonic noted (94.82) HAZARDS: shimmer bursts, 30s comb fade nearby

The spectrogram frames it like a grove:  
- **94.45 MHz**: a cyclic lantern, pulsing dim every 30s.  
- **94.70 MHz**: the moss_garden—its voice thick in the midband, waiting for demod.  
- **94.82 MHz**: slick harmonic with PSA vocal residues, partial impression of speech.  

You’re stood right in the garden clearing at 94.70. Carrier is strong but needs decoding and lock.  

Suggested path:  
`lock` to pin the signal roots, then `demod AUTO` or test `demod FM` to tease out what this mossy texture conceals.  
Or you may `map` to see the band topography around your grove.

### GPT-5 1 ###
LOCK: on (fresh acquire)  
DEMUX: AUTO probing → failed (unclassified midband texture)  
DEMUX: FM retry → coarse audio recovered, watery hiss + buried drone at 220 Hz fundamental  
SNR: ███████░░  

```
94.70  moss_garden   [locked, demod=FM-ish]
```

Tip: run `map 94.4..95.0` to sketch terrain, or try `demod AM` to compare harmonic bleed.

### GPT-5 2 ###
── FREQ: 94.70 MHz SNR: ███████░░ MOD: FM-ish (watery hiss + 220 Hz tone) LOCK: on  
STATIONS: moss_garden (unclassified)  
SIDEBANDS: ±120 kHz harmonic at 94.82 HAZARDS: shimmer bursts, comb fade drift east

Your AUTO probe stumbled on the flora’s thickness, while FM cracked it partly—enough to hear the subterranean 220 Hz drone breathing under hiss. The moss still hides its intent.  

Options:  
- `map 94.4..95.0` will lay down an ASCII sketch of nearby growths/harmonics.  
- `demod AM` might fold in harmonics differently, giving a clearer profile of the drone vs hiss.  
- Or `record 8` to capture a timeframe and look for structure with a follow‑on `spectrogram`.  

The grove responds differently depending on which lens you hold to it.

MAP 94.4..95.0 (ASCII, 600 kHz span):

```

94.45 ╍╍╍╍  cyc lantern pulse ▲ every 30s
94.55 ──░░░ scattered static haze

94.82 ▓▓▓▓ harmonic tongue (PSA residue formants)
94.95 ──░░░ floor rises, shimmer flecks
95.00 ───────────────────── edge
```

Contours: grove ridge at .70, harmonic spur cliff east, dim beacon west.  
SNR gradient slopes downward past .90.  

Next: `demod AM && compare` to test drone contrast.

### GPT-5 2 ###
── FREQ: 94.70 MHz SNR: ██████░░ MOD: attempting AM compare LOCK: on  
STATIONS: moss_garden core (FM-ish prior)  
SIDEBANDS: harmonic tongue at 94.82 HAZARDS: shimmer flecks + comb lantern west

Demodulating in **AM**… the carrier unwraps differently:  
- The watery hiss thins, less wash across midband.  
- The **220 Hz drone** now pulses fuller, like a buried root note vibrating in soil.  
- Harmonic bleed from 94.82 seeps harsher, forming ghost syllables intercut with the drone.  

Comparing:  
- **FM mode** favored atmospheric hiss, masking detail but smoother overall.  
- **AM mode** foregrounds the subterranean pulse and lets harmonic residue creep in, more textured but raw.  

You’re close to characterizing this grove. A prudent next move:  
- `record 6` then `spectrogram` to pin how these textures shift (drone vs harmonic bleed).  
- Or annotate: `annotate "moss_garden core (FM hiss vs AM drone emphasized)"` so the log remembers.

### GPT-5 1 ###
RECORD: 6s captured (AM demod) → [220 Hz drone amplitude modulated, periodic harmonic ghosts at 1.8 kHz]  
SAVED: clip#002.mg.am  

SPECTROGRAM (6s window):  
- 0–500 Hz: strong band, 220 Hz root synchronous pulse  
- 1.7–2.0 kHz: intermittent formant-like wisps (harmonic bleed)  
- 4–8 kHz zone mostly void, hiss is faint residual noise  

```
Profile: root drone + ghost syllable seep
```

Tip: use `annotate "moss_garden core (FM=hiss veil; AM=drone+ghosts)"` to mark log.  
simulator\@radio:\~\$  [FIELD NOTES]  
- Learned: FM veil vs AM root emphasis; 220 Hz drone central signature.  
- Anomaly: ghost formant wisps (1.8 kHz) tied to 94.82 bleed, non‑broadcast flavor.  
- Next: try `filter bandpass 200..250` to isolate the root pulse, or widen scan to chase lantern at 94.45.

### GPT-5 2 ###
── FREQ: 94.70 MHz SNR: ██████░░ MOD: AM (drone+ghosts) LOCK: on  
STATIONS: moss_garden core  
SIDEBANDS: bleed from 94.82 (1.8 kHz ghost syllables)  
HAZARDS: shimmer flecks, cyclic 30s comb pulse west  

Your clip#002 spectrogram is solid proof: the **220 Hz root drone** is the anchor, with harmonic spirits whispering intermittently above. The 4–8 kHz moss canopy that FM revealed is dropped almost entirely in AM view.  

Good next vectors:  
- `annotate "moss_garden core (FM=hiss veil; AM=drone+ghosts)"` to fix into your band‑map memory.  
- `gain +6` or a **bandpass 200..250 Hz** (if filter primitive emerges) could carve the drone cleanly.  
- `tune 94.45` to visit the lantern pulse itself; its 30 s comb might be another node in this ecology.  

Would you like to deepen the **root isolation**, or venture toward the **lantern pulse** for contrast?

### GPT-5 1 ###
ANNOTATE: "moss_garden core (FM=hiss veil; AM=drone+ghosts)" → attached to log, map updated.  

GAIN: +6 dB applied.  
FILTER: bandpass 200..250 Hz instantiated → root drone isolated, SNR ██████████ peak.  
Output trace: clean 220 Hz sinus pattern, 5–6 bpm amplitude swell atop. Harmonic ghosts outside passband now suppressed.  

```
Channel view: FOUNDATION anchored, canopy muted
```

Next step suggestion: `tune 94.45 && lock` to meet lantern pulse node.
