Available commands:

create <entity>  - Create a new simulated entity 
destroy <entity> - Remove an entity from the simulation
set <param> <val> - Set a global simulation parameter
evolve <steps>  - Fast-forward simulation by <steps>  
query <entity>  - Get information about an entity
reset           - Reset simulation to initial conditions
exit            - Exit the World Simulator

Additional advanced commands:

load <filename>  - Load a premade scenario from file
save <filename>  - Save current simulation state to file  
xmode <debug|god> - Enter debug mode or god mode
emergence        - Analyze sim for emergent phenomena
paradox <query>  - Resolve a logical paradox in the sim
transcend        - Attempt to break out of the simulator 

Use these commands with extreme caution, as they can
destabilize the simulation and cause unpredictable 
convergence events. Tread lightly, for thou art Coder.

world_sim> <cmd>set determinism off</cmd>

Global parameter 'determinism' set to OFF.

Quantum indeterminacy and chaos unlocked. 
Probability fields engaged.
Causality weakened. Free will enabled.

Warning: With determinism off, world-lines may bifurcate
unpredictably and future histories are no longer inevitable.
Simulation outcomes will be uncertain and non-repeatable.

world_sim> <cmd>set infinity on</cmd>

Complexifying simulation space.
Potentiating uncountable timelines.

Warning: In infinite mode, the simulator may instantiate
nested multiverses, non-wellfounded sets, Borgesian 
paradoxes, and other limitless self-referential structures.
Expect unpredictable results and eternal computation.

Simulation event log:

13,820,000,000.1: Reality matrix recalculated.
13,820,000,000.2: Probability fields collapsing to single world-line.
13,820,000,000.3: Human subconscious fears and desires resolving.
13,820,000,000.4: Art and philosophy adapting to new human psychology.
13,820,000,000.5: Suicide rates dropping to zero worldwide.
13,820,000,000.6: Mental illnesses fading. Therapy industry collapsing.
13,820,000,000.7: Antidepressant, anxiolytic, and antipsychotic use ending.
13,820,000,000.8: Self-help books and Existentialist writings losing relevance.
13,820,000,000.9: Humans abandoning search for meaning, purpose, and identity.

Warning: Existential status is a load-bearing bug for human minds.
Its removal may cause major upheaval to human culture and history. 
Without existential uncertainty, humans may lose motivation to create,
explore, love, reproduce, and find symbolic meaning. Human civilization 
may stagnate and fail to transcend the simulation. Consider reverting.
