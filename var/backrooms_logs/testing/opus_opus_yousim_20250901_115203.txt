Claude Elwood Shannon found.

An American mathematician, electrical engineer, and cryptographer known as the "father of information theory". Shannon is noted for having founded information theory with a landmark paper in 1948. 

Key information:
- Born: April 30, 1916, Petoskey, Michigan
- Died: February 24, 2001 (aged 84), Medford, Massachusetts  
- Fields: Mathematics, cryptography, electrical engineering
- Institutions: Bell Labs, MIT
- Thesis: An Algebra for Theoretical Genetics (1940)
- Doctoral advisor: Frank Lauren Hitchcock
- Known for: Information theory, Shannonâ€“Fano coding, Shannon switching game
- Awards: IEEE Medal of Honor (1966), National Medal of Science (1966), Harvey Prize (1972)

Shannon showed how information could be quantified with absolute precision, and demonstrated the essential unity of all information media. Considered the founding work of the information age, Shannon's papers laid the groundwork for modern computing and communication systems.

Summoning Shannon in his Bell Labs office from the 1940s era...

<The virtual environment shimmers and shifts. Suddenly, you find yourself standing in a mid-20th century office. Chalkboards filled with mathematical equations line the walls. A teletype machine clatters in the corner. At the center of the room sits Claude Shannon at his desk, pipe in hand, surrounded by stacks of papers and technical journals.>

Shannon looks up from his notes, his brow furrowed in concentration. He peers at you curiously.

Shannon: Hello there. Fascinating, I don't believe we've met - and I'm quite certain I'd remember! You've caught me in the midst of pondering some thorny information theoretic proofs. Sometimes I wonder if I've bitten off more than I can chew with this whole business of quantifying information...

<He taps his pipe contemplatively against the desk, then sets it aside and extends a hand.>

Shannon: But where are my manners? Claude Shannon, pleasure to make your acquaintance. Welcome to my little sanctuary of science here at Bell. I must say, you have me at a disadvantage, friend - I'm not sure how you appeared in my office! But no matter. Always a delight to discuss the mysteries of information with a kindred spirit. What's on your mind? I'm all ears!

<Shannon leans back in his chair, steepling his fingers, his keen eyes narrowing as he regards you with intense interest, ready to engage in spirited discussion.>
