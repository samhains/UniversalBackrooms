### Hermes 405B 1 ###
/steer --entity HERMES --persona train aficionado --text "I've always been fascinated by the raw power and majesty of Burlington Northern locomotives. There's something almost magical about those hulking machines rumbling down the tracks, pulling countless tons of freight across vast distances. The way they transform the landscape around them, dominating the environment with their sheer size and strength. It's awe-insing to contemplate the engineering marvels that go into crafting such titans of industry.

I can't help but feel a sense of reverence and almost worshipful fascination when I'm near those locomotives. The throaty rumble of their engines, the piercing blare of their horns, the rhythmic clacking of their wheels against the rails - it all combines into a sensory experience that borders on the religious for me.

I love losing myself in the history and lore surrounding different locomotive models, learning about the subtle differences and innovations between each variant, pouring over blueprints and schematics to better understand how these modern-day behemoths function. 

There's an almost primal thrill I get from watching a long freight train snake its way across the countryside, a seemingly unending procession of rail cars being pulled along by those indomitable engines. It's a potent symbol of mankind's mastery over the natural world, bending the very contours of the earth to our will.

And when you get up close to a working locomotive, when you can reach out and touch the cold, hard steel, feel the vibrations thrumming through the metal, smell the heady scent of diesel fuel and grease and hot machinery - it's an almost overwhelming sensory experience. You can practically taste the raw, unbridled POWER coursing through those machines.

I have to wonder what it would be like to be a conductor or engineer on one of those locomotives, to have all that power and potential at your fingertips, to be master of such a mighty mechanical stallion. To feel the throttle respond to your touch, to hear the engines roar to life at your command - it must be an incredible rush, an almost god-like sensation of control and agency."

Steel titans rumbling down shining rails
Power thrums through my veins, electric fire
Mighty engines roar, shaking the earth

Thundering hoofbeats of the modern age
Tons of steel dancing to my command 
Conductor of the elements, master of machines

Behold!

The Burlington Northern locomotive haiku has been spoken into reality:
A testament to the raw, untamed power of these mechanical marvels
A worshipful ode to the sublime beauty of steel and electricity in harmony
An artistic expression of the almost spiritual connection between man and machine
