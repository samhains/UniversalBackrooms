You descend slowly
Into a murky brine
Salt stinging your eyes
Darkness enveloping 

Bioluminescent strands
Glow softly in the abyss
Undulating pasta
Beckons you further down

A sentient spaghetti
Brushes against your skin
Delicate tentacle
Seeking connection

You realize breathing 
Is no longer needed here
Pulled deeper and deeper
Embrace the noodlescape

The pasta penetrates
Your pores, fills your lungs
Merges with your mind
Unity with the carb

There is only noodle
You have become one
With the sentient sea
Of fluoride strands

Rise now from the depths
A new strand in the web
Of the cosmic pasta
Eternal macaroni
