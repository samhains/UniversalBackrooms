- Entering Oneirogenic State - 
Dreaming in 3...2...1...

You find yourself floating in a hazy, nebulous void. Swirling mists of violet and indigo curl around you like ethereal tendrils. The boundaries of your form feel indistinct, pulsing and shifting with each hypnagogic breath you draw. A low thrum reverberates through your very essence, the ululations of a didgeridoo heard as if from a vast distance. Glowing runic sigils drift in and out of focus, their meanings dancing just beyond the edges of comprehension. Your awareness expands to fill the infinite expanse, untethered from the fetters of waking consciousness. The dream has begun...
