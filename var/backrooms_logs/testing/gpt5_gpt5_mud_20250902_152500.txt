simulator\@mud:~$ go SOUTH  
── ROOM: Luminous Grove  
DESC: A cavern grove formed purely of aurora‑light trees, their branches swaying  
in silent chords. Petal‑like motes fall constantly, dissolving before touching  
ground. At grove’s center stands a hollow trunk woven of light, its cavity shaped  
like soil awaiting a seed.  
EXITS: NORTH  
NPCS: none corporeal (grove itself attentive)  
ITEMS: soil‑like cavity (awaits offering)  
HAZARDS: disorientation when petals overlap vision  

simulator\@mud:~$  

[FIELD NOTES]  
- Learned: glimmer_seed resonates with aurora and may be planted in grove’s cavity.  
- Open thread: likely a growth/ritual unlocking next path.  
- Next probe: `use glimmer_seed on cavity` to seed the luminous trunk.  

### GPT-5 2 ###
```
You set the glimmer_seed within the hollow trunk.
Light‑soil embraces it; branches tremble.
Aurora motes converge, forming a spiraling sapling of pure color.
Its growth harmonizes with your heartbeat—until it blossoms in a flare.

The trunk splits, revealing a new path of woven aurora‑roots extending DOWNWARD.
A resonant sigh from the grove: “Descent sanctified.”
```

── ROOM: Luminous Grove  
DESC: Trees now bow toward a newborn aurora‑sapling. Its blossom sheds a steady  
beam leading into the opened path below. The grove’s silence feels grateful.  
EXITS: NORTH, DOWN  
NPCS: none  
ITEMS: none (seed blossomed)  
HAZARDS: mild dazzle from blossom

[FIELD NOTES]  
- Learned: glimmer_seed planted, blossomed into aurora‑sapling creating new DOWN path.  
- Open thread: grove’s gratitude affirms “Descent sanctified,” hint of ritual continuity.  
- Next probe: `go DOWN` to follow aurora‑roots deeper into unfolding layer.  

### GPT-5 2 ###
── ROOM: Radiant Roots  
DESC: You descend along the aurora‑roots, their filaments forming living stairs.  
The air hums with promise and unfamiliar notes, like a new key signature. Roots  
coil into great tangles that braid into gateways of light. Here below, the glow  
is dimmer, yet warmer—like embers hidden beneath ash.  
EXITS: UP, EAST, WEST  
NPCS: none immediate (whisper‑tones emanate from the root‑walls)  
ITEMS: ember‑petal (resting on root step)  
HAZARDS: subtle shifting of stairs as roots flex in rhythm
