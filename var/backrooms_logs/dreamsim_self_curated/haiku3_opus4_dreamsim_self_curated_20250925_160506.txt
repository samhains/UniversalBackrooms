I am packing up some stuff and I am hit with a memory of Harry and I surfing together and I start hysterically crying. I wish that Harry and I could go surfing together again.Â  I am setting the table and there is a large blue liqueur with a tiny cork. I use the swirling pointed glass lid of the liquor to prod the cork down , but it gets stuck there. I inform everyone this happened , and Harry looks at me with his signature smile and laughs thinking that it was cute .",
