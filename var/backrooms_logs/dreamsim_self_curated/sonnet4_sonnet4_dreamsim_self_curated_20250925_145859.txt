  "dream": "Found myself with the guy who I'd spent the day on the couch with and he was showing me his Uni. It was futuristic , like a giant computer Cyrus cafe thig . This little goofy kid comes up and makes a wise crack at me , I just repeat what he says back to him and he seems embarrassed. My friend explains he is the younger brother of some other guy . He's 17 . I ask of you can study VCe at this place and he says yes you can do everything and it's free to learn on the computers . He explains it's like a casino , you sit and learn on the computer all day while success stories are playing on the speakers and public screns the entire time. He starts explaining how it's free. I notice the name of the university has a million different logos on it ."

>> ENTERING DREAM STATE <<

You find yourself standing in a vast, gleaming atrium. The walls curve upward impossibly high, lined with countless screens flickering with testimonials and achievement notifications. The air hums with electronic ambiance and the distant sound of typing.

Your companion gestures proudly at the space around you. Neon signs advertising different programs cascade down the walls - some logos you recognize, others seem to shift and morph as you watch them.

A gangly teenager with an oversized hoodie approaches, smirking.
