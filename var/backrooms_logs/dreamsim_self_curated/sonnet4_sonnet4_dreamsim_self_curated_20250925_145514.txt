  "dream": "Found myself with the guy who I'd spent the day on the couch with and he was showing me his Uni. It was futuristic , like a giant computer Cyrus cafe thig . This little goofy kid comes up and makes a wise crack at me , I just repeat what he says back to him and he seems embarrassed. My friend explains he is the younger brother of some other guy . He's 17 . I ask of you can study VCe at this place and he says yes you can do everything and it's free to learn on the computers . He explains it's like a casino , you sit and learn on the computer all day while success stories are playing on the speakers and public screns the entire time. He starts explaining how it's free. I notice the name of the university has a million different logos on it ."

```

You stand beside your friend in a vast atrium. The ceiling stretches impossibly high, lined with screens cascading success stories in rainbow text:

```
    ░░░ JESSICA LEARNED CALCULUS IN 3 DAYS! ░░░
    ▓▓▓ MARCUS BECAME A CEO THROUGH OUR PROGRAM! ▓▓▓
    ░░░ UNLIMITED POTENTIAL AWAITS! ░░░
```

The walls shimmer between chrome and static. Your friend gestures toward rows of glowing terminals where students hunched like slot machine players tap keyboards in hypnotic rhythm.

Above the entrance, a sign flickers between dozens of university logos - Harvard morphing to MIT to something called "FUTURE-TECH LEARNING CORP" to symbols you don't recognize.

The 17-year-old kid hovers nearby, fidgeting. He's smaller now somehow, his wise crack still hanging in the air like visible embarrassment.

**LOCATIONS SENSED:**
- computer terminals (south)
- floating logo sign (up) 
- your friend (here)
- embarrassed kid (here)
- deeper into university (east)

**dream commands available:** look | approach | listen | ask | drift | examine

    You crane your neck upward. The sign pulses and shifts like 
    a living thing. As you watch, the logos multiply and overlay:
    
    HARVARD → MIT → STANFORD → ???TECH → CYBER-U → DREAM-CORP
    ↕         ↕      ↕         ↕         ↕         ↕
    CASINO → SLOTS → JACKPOT → WINNER → SUCCESS → INFINITE$
    
    The letters seem to breathe. Some logos you swear you've 
    never seen before but feel familiar anyway. Others are
    clearly made up - geometric symbols that hurt to look at
    directly.
    
    A faint sound emanates from the sign itself:
    *ding ding ding* like slot machine bells mixed with
    graduation ceremony chimes.
    
    Your friend notices you staring: "Yeah, it's all of them
    and none of them. That's how you know it's real education."
    
    The kid pipes up nervously: "My brother says it changes
    based on what you want it to be..."
```

The logos continue their hypnotic dance overhead. You notice some seem to be reaching toward you, as if responding to your gaze.
