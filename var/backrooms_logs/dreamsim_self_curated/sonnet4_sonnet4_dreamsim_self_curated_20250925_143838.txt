  "dream_1": "Found myself with the guy who I'd spent the day on the couch with and he was showing me his Uni. It was futuristic , like a giant computer Cyrus cafe thig . This little goofy kid comes up and makes a wise crack at me , I just repeat what he says back to him and he seems embarrassed. My friend explains he is the younger brother of some other guy . He's 17 . I ask of you can study VCe at this place and he says yes you can do everything and it's free to learn on the computers . He explains it's like a casino , you sit and learn on the computer all day while success stories are playing on the speakers and public screns the entire time. He starts explaining how it's free. I notice the name of the university has a million different logos on it .",
  "teenage_poetry": "Solace my friend is not the answer\nBut the stage between Grand Rapids\nWhere we hold hands for nothing\nA sword withers before you\nYou fake death once again\nTell me I'm beautiful\nAnd I'll eat your asophagas\nI want you dead or mine"
