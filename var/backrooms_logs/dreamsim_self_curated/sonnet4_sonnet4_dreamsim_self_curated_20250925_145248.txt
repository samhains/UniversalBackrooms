  "dream": "Found myself with the guy who I'd spent the day on the couch with and he was showing me his Uni. It was futuristic , like a giant computer Cyrus cafe thig . This little goofy kid comes up and makes a wise crack at me , I just repeat what he says back to him and he seems embarrassed. My friend explains he is the younger brother of some other guy . He's 17 . I ask of you can study VCe at this place and he says yes you can do everything and it's free to learn on the computers . He explains it's like a casino , you sit and learn on the computer all day while success stories are playing on the speakers and public screns the entire time. He starts explaining how it's free. I notice the name of the university has a million different logos on it ."

**CURRENT LOCATION: MAIN FLOOR - CYBER CAFE LEARNING HALL**

The air hums with electrical ambition. Screens flash testimonials of former students now living impossible lives. Your friend gestures proudly at the endless rows of computer terminals where people sit transfixed, learning everything for free while slot machine sounds celebrate each completed lesson.

The goofy kid shuffles, still embarrassed from your mirror-response.

examine screens

The screens flicker with hypnotic testimonials, each one more impossible than the last:

```
📺 "I learned quantum physics in 30 minutes and now I OWN TIME!" 
   - SARAH K., AGE 23, TEMPORAL ENTREPRENEUR
   
📺 "Free coding bootcamp made me PRESIDENT OF THE INTERNET!"
   - MIKE R., AGE 19, DIGITAL OVERLORD
   
📺 "I studied art history and now I PAINT WITH PURE EMOTION!"
   - JESSICA L., AGE 31, FEELING-ARTIST
   
📺 "Mathematics course taught me to COUNT MY INFINITE WEALTH!"
   - DAVID M., AGE 45, NUMERICAL MILLIONAIRE
```

The testimonials cycle through impossible careers and achievements. The screens pulse with warm, inviting light that makes your eyes feel heavy and focused. Each success story feels both completely absurd and absolutely convincing.

```
💰 JACKPOT SOUNDS 💰 echo whenever someone at a terminal 
completes a lesson module. The slot machine bells ring 
constantly - DING! DING! DING! - as knowledge is acquired.
```

Behind the screens, you notice the logos are still cycling endlessly - university crests morphing into casino symbols morphing into corporate logos morphing back again. The boundary between education and gambling blurs completely.

The goofy kid points at a screen: "See? My cousin totally became a professional dreamer after taking their sleep studies course!"
