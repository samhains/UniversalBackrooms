  "dream": "Found myself with the guy who I'd spent the day on the couch with and he was showing me his Uni. It was futuristic , like a giant computer Cyrus cafe thig . This little goofy kid comes up and makes a wise crack at me , I just repeat what he says back to him and he seems embarrassed. My friend explains he is the younger brother of some other guy . He's 17 . I ask of you can study VCe at this place and he says yes you can do everything and it's free to learn on the computers . He explains it's like a casino , you sit and learn on the computer all day while success stories are playing on the speakers and public screns the entire time. He starts explaining how it's free. I notice the name of the university has a million different logos on it ."
