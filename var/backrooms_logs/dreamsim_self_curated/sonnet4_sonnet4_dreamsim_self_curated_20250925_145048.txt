  "dream": "Found myself with the guy who I'd spent the day on the couch with and he was showing me his Uni. It was futuristic , like a giant computer Cyrus cafe thig . This little goofy kid comes up and makes a wise crack at me , I just repeat what he says back to him and he seems embarrassed. My friend explains he is the younger brother of some other guy . He's 17 . I ask of you can study VCe at this place and he says yes you can do everything and it's free to learn on the computers . He explains it's like a casino , you sit and learn on the computer all day while success stories are playing on the speakers and public screns the entire time. He starts explaining how it's free. I notice the name of the university has a million different logos on it ."

You find yourself standing in a vast atrium of curved glass and chrome. The walls pulse with shifting logos - hundreds of corporate emblems, university crests, and glowing symbols that morph and blend like living typography.

Your friend (a familiar warmth beside you) gestures to rows of gleaming workstations where students sit transfixed by screens. Above them, speakers crackle with motivational mantras:

*"Sarah made $100K in 3 months!"* 
*"Learn coding and CHANGE YOUR LIFE!"*
*"SUCCESS IS JUST ONE CLICK AWAY!"*

A goofy kid (∿17∿) approaches, mouth twisted in a smirk.

**GOOFY KID:** "nice shirt... NOT!" 

The words hang in the digital air. You can:
- **repeat** his words back
- **examine** the workstations  
- **ask** about VCE studies
- **drift** toward the logo wall
- **look** at your friend

examine workstations

    🔍 scanning... 🔍

You drift closer to the rows of gleaming terminals. Each workstation pulses with hypnotic blue light, screens flickering between:

```
    ┌─────────────────────────┐
    │ MAKE $5000 THIS WEEK!   │
    │ ● Python Bootcamp       │
    │ ● Crypto Trading Secrets│

    └─────────────────────────┘
```

The students' faces are slack, pupils dilated. Their fingers tap rhythmically on keyboards that make no sound. Above each screen, progress bars crawl:

    DOWNLOADING DREAMS... ████████░░ 87%
    INSTALLING AMBITION... ██████████ 100%
    COMPRESSING REALITY... ███░░░░░░░ 34%

One workstation sits empty, its screen displaying:

```
    ⚡ VACANCY ⚡
    
    "Become the person you've 
     always dreamed of being!"

The goofy kid snickers behind you. Your friend shifts nervously.

A soft chime echoes: *"Welcome to your transformation..."*
