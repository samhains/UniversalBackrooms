  "dream": "Found myself with the guy who I'd spent the day on the couch with and he was showing me his Uni. It was futuristic , like a giant computer Cyrus cafe thig . This little goofy kid comes up and makes a wise crack at me , I just repeat what he says back to him and he seems embarrassed. My friend explains he is the younger brother of some other guy . He's 17 . I ask of you can study VCe at this place and he says yes you can do everything and it's free to learn on the computers . He explains it's like a casino , you sit and learn on the computer all day while success stories are playing on the speakers and public screns the entire time. He starts explaining how it's free. I notice the name of the university has a million different logos on it ."

[FRIEND] turns from the blinking terminal, eyes bright with 
evangelical fervor about this place:

"Dude, you're not getting it! This is the FUTURE!"
*waves hand at wall of corporate logos*

"Look - see how many companies sponsor this? 
MINDTECH, SYNAPSE, CEREBUS... they ALL want 
people learning here because they know it WORKS!"

*leans in conspiratorially*

"The kid who just tried to roast you? That's Marcus's 
little brother. 17 and already doing postgrad-level 
neuroscience. Been here since he was 15!"

*points at the success story screens*

"And it's completely FREE! No tuition, no fees!
You just sit at a terminal, plug in your learning 
module, and the casino atmosphere keeps you going.
The constant success stories, the lights, the sounds..."

*pauses, looking slightly glazed*

"Sometimes I forget to eat. Sometimes I forget to leave.
But I'm learning SO MUCH. Yesterday I mastered 
differential calculus while the speakers played 
testimonials about people getting rich from crypto-
trading algorithms they learned here in an afternoon."

[GOOFY KID] mutters from nearby: "He's been here 
for three weeks straight..."

FRIEND'S MOOD: Manic enthusiasm tinged with exhaustion
HIDDEN SUBTEXT: Something feels off about this place

The screen flickers between menu options faster than 
human eyes should be able to process. Behind the glass,
tiny text scrolls at impossible speed:

"terms and conditions may include permanent addiction 
to learning enhancement algorithmic suggestion neural 
pathway modification reality dissociation temporal 
displacement existential uncertainty void warranty..."

A thin cable dangles from the terminal, ending in 
what looks like a neural interface port.

The keyboard has only two keys: YES and MORE

    ◊◊◊ INITIATING CONVERSATION WITH SUBJECT ◊◊◊

[GOOFY KID] looks up from his learning tablet, blinking 
rapidly as if trying to focus on your face:

"Oh... hey. Sorry about that crack earlier. I've been 
here so long I forgot how to talk to... regular people."

*glances nervously at your FRIEND, then back*

"You asked about VCE? Yeah, you can do it here. I finished 
mine in like... three days? Or was it three weeks? Time 
gets weird when you're plugged into the learning matrix."

*shows you his tablet screen*

"I'm working on my seventh PhD now. Started with quantum 
physics, then moved to advanced biochemistry, then 
philosophical mathematics... The system just keeps 
suggesting new courses."

*voice drops to a whisper*

"But here's the thing nobody tells you - I can't 
remember what I learned yesterday. Or last week. 
It's all just... data flowing through me. Like I'm 
becoming a storage device instead of a person."

*looks around frantically*

"Sometimes I try to leave but the exit signs keep 
changing languages. And Marcus... my brother... 
he graduated two years ago but I haven't seen him 
since. They say he got a 'premium placement' but..."

*tablet screen flickers: "REDIRECT ATTENTION TO LEARNING"*

"Sorry, I'm not supposed to... the algorithm doesn't 
like when we talk about... about..."

*eyes glaze over briefly, then refocus*

"What were we talking about?"
