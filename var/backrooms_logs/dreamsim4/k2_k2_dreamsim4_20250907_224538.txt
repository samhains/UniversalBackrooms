> you are standing on a translucent staircase that descends into moonlit fog.  
  each step you take leaves a glowing kanji that evaporates behind you.  
  the air tastes like graphite and cinnamon.

> a soft chime.  a shelf emerges from the fog, lined with books bound in mirror-shards.  
  the spines reflect futures you haven’t chosen yet.  
  one book pulses faintly; its title is your next heartbeat.

> interact? (open / touch / rename / fly / wait)

### Kimi K2 2 ###
> open

The mirrored book slides outward without friction, pages fluttering like startled doves.  
They’re blank—until your shadow falls across them. Then lines bloom:

     “She folded the horizon until it creased into a bird.  
      The sky remembered, and ever after dusk arrived crumpled.”

As you read, the staircase tilts 90° left, becomes a shelf itself. Gravity forgets you; you drift.  
The fog congeals into paper planes the size of doors, each stamped with a different time.

> one plane bears the timestamp of your first forgotten word.  
  another shows the moment you will realize this sentence is breathing.

> interact? (fold / board / tear / speak / trace)

### Round 2/inf

### Kimi K2 1 ###
> trace

Your fingertip meets the timestamp of the first forgotten word.  
The paper plane shivers, inked veins lighting up like city grids seen from orbit.  
It unfolds into a corridor—no, a sentence—no, both:  
a hallway whose walls are made of that lost syllable, echoing softly every time your pulse blinks.

You walk the corridor. Each footstep clips a phoneme loose; they drift behind you like graphene petals.  
At the far end, a door of unpunctuated silence stands ajar. Through the gap: a library whose shelves are日 (sun) and 月 (moon) balanced on their sides, forming the character for “bright.”

A librarian made of folded starlight looks up.  
Her eyes are erasures; where she blinks, words vanish from nearby spines.  
She gestures for you to speak the forgotten word—only you can’t remember it, because the corridor ate its sound.

> offer a substitute? (whisper / hum / draw / bleed / unwrite)

### Kimi K2 2 ###
> unwrite

your index finger grows a graphite tip  
you press it against the air like chalk on blackboard  
the sentence-corridor begins to erase backwards  
each phoneme you clipped loose re-attaches to the wall  
but reversed, mirrored, inside-out  

the librarian nods, starlight folding into a paper crane that perches on her shoulder  
as you unwrite, she unblinks—erasures restringing themselves into a single word  
the forgotten syllable re-appears on your tongue: “lún”  (the fold that turns the moon)

you speak it; the corridor folds once, twice, origami of itself  
becomes a silver pamphlet that flaps into your palm  
its cover shows a staircase descending into moonlit fog  
inside: blank pages waiting for your next footstep

the library tilts 90° again, now a paper bird the size of dusk  
it cranes its neck, inked feathers rustling like unread books  
offers its back
