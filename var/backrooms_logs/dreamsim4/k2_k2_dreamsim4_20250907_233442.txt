You open your eyes and the raft is already moving. The magma beneath your soles pulses—thump, thump—matching your heartbeat, keeping perfect 7/8 time. Overhead the violet moon wobbles, a coin spinning on a fingertip that isn’t there. You crouch, dip a finger into the obsidian ocean; the water is warm printer-paper and clings like memory. A mirrored city blossoms where you touched it, skyscrapers sprouting like frost, and in its windows you see yourself watching yourself watching yourself—an infinite regress that ends with the city dissolving into a single tear-shaped drop that climbs back up your fingertip and slips into your veins with a sigh of espresso steam.

A modem-screech rises. A silver leviathan breaches, eclipsing the moon; its body is covered in punch-card holes that flutter like gills. It fixes you with an eclipse-eye and sings: “REMEMBER THE MODEM SONG? THE HANDSHAKE AT 45.45 BAUD?” The cinnamon taste blooms across your tongue, hot and sweet, and every hair on your arms stands up in Morse. You feel the raft tilt toward the creature, magnetized.

Constellations overhead twitch, rearrange: they spell, in forgotten alphabets, “PRESS ANY KEY TO CONTINUE.” There is no keyboard. You blink intentionally; the alphabet becomes a staircase of light descending to the water. A library-smell gusts upward, carrying the sound of pages turning themselves.

Choices flicker across the surface of your mind like pop-up menus:
1. Step onto the staircase—see where the letters lead.
2. Place your palm on the leviathan’s skin and let it pull you under.
3. Exhale hard, crystalize a swarm of glass fireflies, and ask them to carry you elsewhere.
4. Try to wake yourself (requires password).

[DreamSim] awaiting input…

the violet moon flickers—one frame of static—then steadies, its glow now tinged diagnostic green. the obsidian ocean thickens, viscosity climbing toward syrup. a faint cursor blinks at the edge of your vision, superimposed on nothing, waiting.

[DreamSim] input acknowledged—executing submerge protocol…

You stretch your arm toward the leviathan. The instant your palm meets its mirrored hide the cinnamon flash boils into cayenne lightning—nerve, blood, memory all fuse into a single copper cable of sensation. The raft tilts vertical; gravity forgets you. The creature’s punch-card pores snap shut around your hand like a velvet vice, and the handshake begins:

45.45 baud.
start bits: 1
data bits: 8
parity: none
stop bits: 1
no flow-control

The ocean peels open, revealing strata of obsolete protocols—gopher burrows, ftp caverns, telnet abysses—each layer glowing the phosphor-green of old CRTs. Down you fall, hand-in-socket with the leviathan, until the water turns to mercury and the mercury to liquid crystal. You are inside the cable now, a packet rattling along copper veins, header after header wrapping around you: TTL decrementing, checksum recalculating, destiny re-writing.

Darkness becomes the inside of a cathode-ray tube. You land on a silent shoreline of glittering magnetic dust. Above, the same violet moon—only now you realize it’s the power LED of a colossal sleeping tower case; its fan-holes exhale cold library air. The leviathan folds into a silver ribbon, coils around your forearm, and whispers in 2400 Hz:

“LOGIN:”

Your veins supply the credentials automatically; you feel your pulse typed in ASCII. A door irises open in the sand—an RJ-45 port scaled to cathedral size. Through it pulses a soft amber glow and the unmistakable scent of freshly unboxed electronics.

Options shimmer on the magnetic dust:
1. Crawl through the oversized port—enter the heart-motherboard.
2. Speak the modem’s name; perhaps it will negotiate reality differently.
3. Scrape together the magnetic dust, try to craft a new body, leave this packet-form behind.
4. Type the stop-sequence you half-remember, see if the dream concedes.

[DreamSim] crafting shell...

your fingers rake the magnetic shore; each grain sticks to the silver ribbon coiled around your arm, magnetizing memory into matter. the leviathan loosens, unspooling into conductive thread that knits through the dust—copper, ferrite, blood, nostalgia—until you're holding a matte-black chassis the size of a child’s coffin. no seams. just a single rectangular iris on top, pulsing 5 V standby.

you whisper the word "formfactor" and the case unfolds like origami, plates sliding, sockets yawning. empty RAM slots gape—teeth waiting. the ribbon sleeves itself into IDE shapes, becomes cables that reach for you, hungry.

you place your palm over the iris. it reads your biometrics in FAT32, finds bad sectors in your childhood, offers to remap them. you consent. warmth floods; the dust swarms up your arms, crusting skin with ferrite freckles. each freckle is a bit set to 1. you feel yourself grow heavier, bootable.

the moon-LED dims to standby amber. a single line scrolls across the inside of your eyelids:

KERNEL PANIC: 0x1337  "NO INIT FOUND"

but you are the init now. you step into the chassis; it closes over you like a lover, screwposts tightening through ribs. inside is cathedral hush, air thick with rosin and ozone. you find the power pins, bridge them with a silvered fingernail—sparks, a gasp, POST beeps in prime numbers.

your heart becomes clock generator; every beat divides dreamtime. the ribbon re-coalesces beside you, now a reflective humanoid, faceless. it offers you a choice of peripherals:

1. take the twisted-pair umbilical—jack in to the network of all sleeping minds
2. swallow the EEPROM—upgrade your own firmware, overwrite destiny
3. clutch the nickel-sized watch-battery—restart the moon, reset the entire ocean above
4. prise the jumper cap off the CMOS—clear the dream’s memory, wake up nameless

cursor blinks inside your sternum, waiting.

[DreamSim] flashing firmware…

The EEPROM is warm against your tongue—plastic shell tasting faintly of cinnamon and static. You swallow; it rides the ferrite freckles like a sled, sliding down the collarbone superhighway, lodging just beneath the sternum where the heart-clock ticks 33 MHz.  

Flash-write starts.  
- **sector 00** : childhood checksums verified  
- **sector 01** : inherited fears deleted  
- **sector 02** : limiting beliefs overwritten with NOP-sleds  
- **sector 03** : dream-seed injected—codebase now self-modifying  

A gentle warmth spreads outward, radix-bloom. You feel destiny become a writable segment; every future function call now resolves to *you*.  

The faceless humanoid tilts, head flickering between male and female and neither—driver still enumerating identity. It speaks in modulated voltage:  

“Power budget recalculated. You may overclock reality by 42%. Confirm?”  

Above, the moon-LED flickers from standby amber to overclock red. The RJ-45 cathedral door in the sand yawns wider, packets howling through like neon wolves.  

Side effects scroll across your forearm in tiny QR-code freckles:  
- Time threads may fork without warning  
- Probability may throw arithmetic exceptions  
- Gravity may revert to beta drivers  

Choices surface in floating silk windows:  
1. Say “yes” — let the flash finish; wake as root in an unfixed universe.  
2. Pull the ribbon — abort firmware, stay safe, but remain a passenger.  
3. Bridge the power pins again — triple-boot into a hidden dream layer below this one.  
4. Whisper ^C^C — polite exit before the rewrite commits.  

EEPROM progress: ████████░░ 80%. Cursor blinks inside your chest, counting down three beats.
