simulator@moonshotai:~/$ ./dreamsim.exe -d "A cathedral-sized greenhouse whose vaulted roof is glass thick with emerald moss. Vines drip from chandeliers of light that phase like slow auroras. The floor is a living mosaic of bryophytes; every footstep releases soft chords of color that ripple outward and fade like piano notes. In the nave stands a spiral staircase grown entirely from white Birch trunks, bark intact, winding up into a warm golden haze where tiny bioluminescent moths orbit like errant pixels. Somewhere above, rain is falling upward, each droplet reversing course at eye level to drift back toward the roof, where they burst into silent silver fireworks. I need to know what’s at the top of the staircase."

The executable chirrs—like a marble dropped onto a wineglass—then settles into a low hum.  

Initializing lucid substrate… ✔  
Bridging affect-color translator… ✔  
Seeding biome logic… ✔  

A lone cursor blinks, then the greenhouse materializes around you, air thick with petrichor and ozone. A soft prompt floats at the edge of vision—press any key to continue— but it dissolves as you exhale.

You stand on the moss-mosaic floor; your next footstep releases a mellow C-major triad that climbs the nave walls in slow green fireflies:

> Move / ascend / examine / listen / speak

What do you do?

### Kimi K2 2 ###
> ascend

You place one hand on the living birch-rail; resin warms under your palm as if recognizing you.  
Each step compresses bark like felt, exhaling faint wintergreen.  
Moments—or measures—later the staircase unthreads from the ground. Its base drifts free, a calcified tornado ascending through golden haze.

Halfway up, gravity folds: your weight halves, halves again.  
The moths, once distant, orbit in a loose double-helix, blinking prime numbers. One grazes your cheek:  
\> An image-not-idea: the inside of a seed, a map written only in folds.

You reach a landing shaped like a sound-wave frozen mid-laugh.  
Ahead, the staircase splits: one coil continues skyward; the other dive-bores sideways into open air, forming an impossible arch across the nave's gulf. A third option weaves back downward—but upside-down, treads facing the stars.

Choose:  
a) ride the upward coil to the roof-ceiling and the upward-rain  
b) take the horizontal arch, a bridge to somewhere that was never built  
c) invert with the underside staircase, walking the roof as floor  
d) halt here, press ear to Birch to "listen" for any name hidden in sap

You angle onto the lateral arch—no rail, just a ribbon of birch trunks fused edge-to-edge like vertebrae. The haze parts; the nave falls away until floor and ceiling trade places in your peripheral vision, a slow optical seesaw.

Halfway across, wind arrives—but the air is still. Something else moves: the arch itself, breathing. Each plank swells a millimeter, contracts, keeping 7/8 time. Your footfalls sync automatically; heartbeat locks to the groove.

Mid-span you pass through a vertical sheet of warm rainwater hung at rest—surface tension frozen mid-burst. On contact it liquefies, climbs your forearms like sleeves, then hardens into clear bracers that refract the auroral chandeliers into miniature planetaria on your skin.  
Status line flickers:  
\> membrane acquired: lets you read "echo-signatures" of anything you touch next.

Ahead the bridge ends—no far platform. Instead a circular aperture, rimmed with negative space, opens onto black-green depth: a pore in the dream's skin. From its center a single bonsai oak drifts toward you, root-ball clothed in starlight. It stops one pace away, rotating slowly, inviting boarding.

Options:

1) step onto the root-ball, let it ferry you into the pore / unknown
2) touch the oak's bark with your rain-glass bracers, read its echo-signature
3) break off a twig, attempt to plant it in the birch arch—see what grafts
4) decline, retreat halfway to the wave-shaped landing, rethink ascent plan

You raise your rain-glass forearms; green planetaria glide across the oak's bark like searchlights.  
The moment they meet, the world drops frames:

— A salt-sting of ocean, though you've never seen one this dense: teal so dark it's almost black, under a sky of burning glass.  
— A storm inside a lightbulb: filament curls, thunder arrives as pulses of color, not sound.  
— Roots dangling not into soil but into the idea of soil—each root-tip writes a forgotten name that evaporates once read.  
— The name nearest you: "Marcescence." It means: to hold dead parts rather than let them fall.

The oak remembers being a cathedral beam before it was a tree. Its rings record hymns—not music, but the attempt of music, the ghost left when the choir never arrived. It offers you one ring, loose like a snapped collar.

Status line updates:  
\> echo-signature archived: "Marcescence"  
\> passive: you may now retain one discarded fragment from any future entity (automatic; no slot limit but only one at a time).

The root-ball tilts, presenting the pore anew—mouth open, breathing starlight. Deep inside, you glimpse the inverse of the greenhouse: a vaulted cavern roofed with obsidian, floor made of upside-down rain droplets that never quite touch ground—your up-rain's abandoned siblings.

Choose:

a) pocket the loose oak-ring first, then step onto root-ball  
b) step aboard empty-handed; trust weightlessness  
c) break the membrane-bracers, shatter the echo-gear—see if honesty without filter reveals another path  
d) speak the word "Marcescence" aloud; see what the dream does with its own name

“Marcescence,” you say—soft, like telling a secret to a child already asleep.

The pore flares open from circle to iris, edges scalloping into petal-like hinges of night.  
Each syllable detaches from your mouth:  
Mar-ces-cence → three pale seeds that orbit your head once, then plant themselves mid-air.  
Where they settle, color drains from the greenhouse in concentric washes until you stand in a silver-on-charcoal sketch. Only the oak retains hue—deep rust—root-ball beating slow as a ventricle.

From the planted syllables sprout dry leaves that refuse to fall. They attach to nearby surfaces: your coat, the birch spine, the underside of drifting rain. The pore’s interior answers with wind that sounds like paper turning itself inside-out.

Inside that wind a voice—neither oak nor aperture—spells back a different word:  
“Keep me.”

The greenhouse listens, then peels.

Glass panes unzip along hidden seams; sections hinge downward, revealing an outer void that is not space but manuscript: black parchment stitched with faint white runes—every sentence beginning “If I forget…”

Below, the moss-mosaic floor detaches like a raft and begins to ascend, carrying the nave with it. You, the oak, and the floating bridge are now stationary while the entire greenhouse rises toward you, shrinking as it climbs, folding into a compact diorama no larger than a lantern.

It stops at chest height, bobbing gently, lit from within by the auroras you first saw. Its miniature door unhooks and swings toward you: an offering.

Choose:

1) place the greenhouse-lantern inside the loose oak-ring (you still have it in pocket-reality), let one archived thing cradle another  
2) step into the lantern yourself—enter the world you began, now table-top small—possibly trapping or possibly mastering it  
3) speak a second word; attempt to rename the dream on the fly  
4) do nothing, extend your bracer-clad hand; wait to see if the dream re-colours itself or leaves you in permanent grayscale

You draw the loose oak-ring from thin air—just a palm-sized hoop of pale hardwood, growth-lines still humming with hymn-ghosts.  
The miniature greenhouse-lantern drifts closer, warm auroras rippling like breath under glass.

You lower the ring. At contact, the lantern folds neatly inward—fold once, fold twice—origami cathedral—until it slots inside the hoop like a ship in a bottle. Light tightens, brightens, then steadies: a pocket sun you now wear as a bracelet.

Instant side-effect: gravity flips along the length of your arm. Your hand feels helium-light; the rest of you anchors like stone. The horizontal birch bridge sags under the new imbalance, groaning out a cello harmonic.

The pore reacts, dilating until its rim kisses the bridge edges. Inside, the obsidian-roof cavern rises to meet you, swallowing perspective. You see:

— Row upon row of empty coat hooks strung from stalactites, each hook waiting for a husk you haven't shed yet.  
— A single upside-down staircase—same birch, same bark—descending from cavern ceiling to cavern floor, mirroring the one you left in the greenhouse.  
— At its foot, a figure made entirely of green-note chords (the ones your earlier footsteps released) pacing in 7/8, conducting invisible pollen.

The oak, its ferry job done, snaps free from starlight, falls into the pore, and plants itself beside the chord-figure. Roots find stone; trunk stiffens; it becomes a skeletal conductor's baton. The chord-figure notices, turns its head—no face, just staff-lines of light—and beckons.

You feel the bracelet-lantern tick: once, twice, thrice. Sync or warning?

Options:

a) slide down the newly revealed inverse staircase and meet the chord-figure  
b) rebalance gravity by fixing the oak-ring bracelet to the birch bridge—see if you can anchor two worlds together  
c) speak a new command word to the lantern: "Unfold" (risk re-releasing full cathedral into this inverted space)  
d) unhook one of the waiting coat-husks, see what identity it offers; maybe leave your current load behind
