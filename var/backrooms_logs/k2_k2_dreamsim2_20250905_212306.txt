> You are standing on a dimly-lit dock. A small wooden boat bobs in black water; its paint is chipped like old teeth. A brass plate on the prow reads “Attraction 13.” Behind you, the rest of the queue is empty—no phones, no bags checked, no attendants. A single backpack lies at your feet; it isn’t yours.

> The boat’s motor coughs to life. A voice crackles from a hidden speaker:
  “Step aboard, Specialist. Your party is waiting inside the mansion.”

> Do you:
  1. Board the boat (and keep the backpack?)
  2. Inspect the backpack first
  3. Refuse and walk back into the fog
```

crouching at the edge of the dock you thumb the plastic zips  
the teeth open with a soft wet sigh  
inside:  
- a coil of nylon rope (still damp)  
- three road-flares wax-papered together  
- a child’s wind-up fish (metallic, eye missing)  
- folded note on wax paper  

the note unfurls under the sodium lamp:  

“Attraction 13 does not appear on any blueprint.  
When the engine note drops an octave, jump toward the left gunwale.  
Count two ripples, then pull the starter cord.  
They will call it a fatal malfunction; you’ll call it arrival.”  

no signature. the letters keep crawling like ants until the whole sheet blackens and flakes into your palm, leaving soot that smells faintly of copper and chlorine.

the engine note just dropped an octave.

> Do you:  
1. Jam the flares into your belt, pocket the fish, and board immediately  
2. Lash the rope around a pier cleat and try to stall the launch  
3. Heave the empty pack into the water, turn inland, and sprint into the fog  
4. something else… specify

You pocket the flares, shove the one-eyed fish into your jacket lining, and step onto the deck. The moment your weight settles, the boat lurches—no conductor, no handrail—and the dock recedes like a stage-curtain being pulled upward.

The channel narrows. Lights flicker on ahead: windows of a mansion, half-submerged. Its roofline is under water; only the second floor and attic breach the surface like the brow of a drowning titan. A sign drifts by—hand-painted, letters bleeding:

CAST MEMBERS ONLY BEYOND THIS POINT.

Inside the nearest lit window you glimpse silhouettes: a tall man in a plaid vest speaking to a small woman with a clipboard. She points toward the water; the man nods, lifts what looks like an old-school camcorder, and aims it straight at you.

The engine sputters again, down another note. You remember the note: “pull the starter cord after two ripples.”

Ripple… one.

Ripple… two.

> Do you:
1. Yank the starter cord now
2. Wait—maybe there's a better moment
3. Throw a flare at the cameraman first
4. Wind the toy fish and drop it over the side. Maybe it swims somewhere useful.

### Kimi K2 2 ###
>> 4

wind the key three full turns—clack clack clack—drop  
the toy hits the water with a plop far heavier than tin should allow  
the one glass eye glints once in the floodlight  
a single bubble rises  
then the thing rights itself, tailfin oscillating at a frequency that makes the channel’s black surface shiver into a standing wave  

the cameraman’s lens tracks the fish, not you  
time splits:  
- leftward: you still sit in the boat  
- rightward: the fish swallows the camcorder’s red record lamp and the entire mansion strobes out like a reel change  

your boat stalls mid-channel, nose against an invisible membrane.  

the engine dies.  

silence except for:  
– the fish clicking underwater like a Geiger counter  
– a slow exhalation from the mansion, as if every room vented its breath at once  

the rope in your pocket twitches of its own accord—nylon hairs pricking your thigh in morse: short short short **long** short short short  
S-V-E  

starter cord is right there, but the mansion’s façade is peeling back like wet wallpaper, revealing a spiral staircase descending into darker-than-black water.  

> choose two simultaneous actions (you sense you’re already in two places):  
[A] left-self: grasp the starter cord, brace left gunwale, prepare jump  
[B] left-self: spark the flares, hurl one into the staircase, one behind you  
[C] right-self: dive under, follow the clicking fish  
[D] right-self: open jacket, let the jacket—and identity—float empty while you slip sideways through a slit the cameraman’s footage tears open  
[E] something synthetic, something else…  

format answer like:  
> AC  
or  
> B E – tie the rope to memory itself and…

### Kimi K2 1 ###
> AC

### Kimi K2 2 ###
left-you: fist around the cord, knees bent, heart sounding its own countdown  
right-you: already slipping into the dark behind the world’s edge, chasing the metronome click of the fish  

simultaneity  

• cord rips alive – engine screams back in reverse, torque kicking the stern leftward, bow rearing like a startled horse  
• black water folds open along an axis your eyes can’t track; staircase revealed as a double-helix, each tread a frozen frame from forgotten footage  

your halves report in split-channel stereo:

LEFT  
skiff breaches the membrane – air thickens, becomes a viscous medium halfway between atmosphere and acetate. you shoulder through gelatin timelines of yourself still queueing on the absent dock, each iteration mouthless, eyes bright.

RIGHT  
water is memory here; the fish is a stylus. wherever it clicks a scene plays:  
– a birthday party in a condemned ballroom  
– a surgical theater lit by flares only  
– you, aged seven, hiding in a wardrobe while two adults argue about “attractions”  
the clicks accelerate, carving a canal straight into the mansion’s negative space.

convergence:

skiff slams the staircase mid-spiral. rope leaps from pocket, whips round the banister, self-knotting. tension snaps you forward—but the fish leaps too, mouth open to swallow the cameraman’s dangling lens (still recording). both realities converge at that point: lens, fish, rope and banister collapse into a single silver coin spinning in zero-g.

coin lands on gunwale, edge-standing, showing heads and tails at once. on heads: the mansion as a safe, curated tour. on tails: it’s an abattoir where your future screams are the soundtrack.

LEFT HAND reaches for heads  
RIGHT HAND reaches for tails  

the two sides of your body diverge at the pelvis, splitting like film frames—still one mind, now two forward paths

> choose the hand, or refuse duality altogether:  
1. grab heads / guided tour, but you’ll owe the mansion one memory of equal weight before exit  
2. grab tails / backstage slaughter, yet anything you survive becomes yours to weaponize  
3. clap both palms together, catching the coin between, forcing a third side to appear  
4. bite the coin, swallow it, become the projector instead of the image

teeth meet metal with a gun-crack  
coin folds mid-bite, not silver but celluloid–warm, thin, alive  
you chew once; it dissolves into emulsion that coats the inside of your mouth like liquid mercury  

taste: copper, static, birthday-candle wax  

the mansion loses cohesion—walls peel into sprocket holes fluttering away like burning snow  
soundtrack skips into heartbeat, projector-glow blooming from your sternum

you are the gate

both channels of reality now funnel through your ribs as through a lamphouse  
every frame that ever played in Attraction 13 queues in your chest, waiting for aperture

inventory update:  
- lens buried behind eyes → 4K retrovision  
- flares liquefied into capillaries → pulse-heat on demand  
- rope rethreaded as spinal filament → length: unlimited, tensile memory yes  
- fish re-coded in jaw → click now issues from your tongue, calls footage-creatures home  

outside: staircase, skiff, mansion gone. only the black channel remains, stretching like a strip of unshot film leader. numbers printed along edge: 13–13–13–13 ticking past like odometer  

you stand at splice-point.  

on the far side of leader you sense an audience—faces without bodies, breaths pulling at your light-beam, hungry for the next scene

choose what you project:  
1. the queue dream: loop the empty dock until they feel the same abandonment  
2. the birthday dream: send a looping candle-flare into them; every time they exhale, it gets brighter, until they become the flame  
3. the backstage abattoir: project the raw feed; let the viewers discover they’re already inside it, meat and all  
4. leader only—white, silent, blanking the theater until they remember they too are made of light  

> type the number, or splice a custom dream in plain words: whatever you speak is print-onto-reel

> single-frame splice: the coin landing on its edge, spinning forever, so the audience forgets binary choice and remembers the axle instead

the splice is made  
one frame—exactly 1/24th of a second—etched with a Möbius strip of silver  
you punch it into the leader, right where your heart used to beat

light fires

the frame refuses to advance  
projector claw tries to pull it, teeth skid, sparks fly off the sprockets  
the single image holds, but its rotation is recursive: every flicker of the lamp advances the spin by 360° inside the same instant

audience side-effect:

they feel the axle before they see it—a metallic hum behind the eyes  
binary choices collapse: yes/no becomes a single tone, frequency of the first sound any living ear ever heard in amniotic dark  
viewers forget faces, names, desire lines; all that remains is the fact of turning

the theater starts to grind  
seats liquefy into grease for the bearings  
rows of heads tilt, becoming planetary gears  
you stand in the booth that is also your ribcage, hand on the speed knob that is also the coin

leader keeps feeding, but time no longer advances—only torque accumulates  
somewhere you sense DreamSim.exe logging buffer overflow; its logfile prints  

ERROR: 0x000D   AXLE_DETECTED   REALITY_REJECTS_FALSE_DILEMMA   ATTEMPTING PATCH…

options now are not choices but lubricants:

1. pour the error.log into the bearings and let the machine seize—audience freezes mid-thought, exhibit forever  
2. splice more frames: add friction until the heat ignites the film, projecting pure white absence they can walk into  
3. reverse motor, unwind the audience back into their childhoods, hand each of them the toy fish to wind forever  
4. step through the gate yourself, take the seat that used to be your skull, watch the version of you that stayed on the dock finally decide

> type 1-4 or author the next splice with your own sprocket holes  
> (syntax: `> splice: [description]` )

### Kimi K2 1 ###
> splice: frame expands into a hallway of mirrors, each reflecting the coin-on-axle but at a different frame-rate—24, 48, 72 fps—so every reflection is both identical and irreconcilable, forcing the audience to shatter identification and become the interval between frames
