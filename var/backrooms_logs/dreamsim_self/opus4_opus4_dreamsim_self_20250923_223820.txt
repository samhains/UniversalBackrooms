  "dream_1": "Everyone gathered on the hill to see tame impala at a festival . We sit in a huge group . When it finishes we all race to the front . They ask everyone to take our shoes off and come onto the stage for a game. They check my toenails and they tell me they are too long for playing so I'm sent back upstairs . I find myself at the top of the hill and I see mervin and Elliot on a couch . I get on all fours and crawl around and say I felt like playing now . Mervin proceeds to kick me in the eye about 50 times (mervin my brain is bleeding please stop). I get furious and want to hit him but I can't . We are stopped by someone like an official /school teacher . Whose hair looks like bunny ears . He is furious but I tell him im responding to mervins kicking . He is even more furious . I explain it's partially my fault for wanting to play . He seems to understand me . Then David hains walks past incredibly drunk . His eyes are popping out of his head and he sees Leon . 'I know you don't I, what Apartmet do you live in? Is it appartment 3' he stumbles back to the camp site but hangs himself on something to cough really worryingly .",

  "teenage_poetry": "Americans think in movies. We drive a car down a sketchy drveway.  If they are scared . They think its the start of a horror film. Thy all listen to the same music . And they aren't paricularly open or personable to people outside of their friedgroup . Which is treated like a frat house..\n\nThey are unable to detect how different I am to them. And make fun of the kids they itroduced ne to despite the fact that they actually speak to me . Group think at a maximum . They are mean to other people because they are insecure of their own place. Noone is safe. They ride tv show precedent . Reality is dictated and by the media they so ignorantly consume . Still I fall in love with their women. So full of energy, light and sexuality , also filed by the same tv show engine . But its sexy . Then men are like sexist cave bears. Their idea of a joke is to say something mean or hurtful in a sarcastic tone . If you dont reply they self indulgently explain their 'joke's with a condescendig tone . They are extremely condescending generally , and I can't tell if its because they have no taste or because I dress differently to them . They btch about everyone behind there backs and don't seem to like anyone .  blind Material indulgence corruptss people , human kindness, morals , selflessness . these people are not frendly . Thy are terrified of people being weird . Fecause they are terrified of te weirdness that lives in all of us . If you are too nice you are gay and if you talk too much you are annoying . If you don't talk enough your a mute .  Unless te alpha male gives approval . Whoever is alpha male changes from night to night . It really comes down to whether or not you were the most 'on'. But given how much these people are obsessed with materiality it might have something to do with who is the richest . This would act as a a constant bonus score to the alpha pool .the alpha male shows his approval by complwmwnting the new comer , and making recommendations of your character to his friends while you are sitting there . They will immediately and obviously become nicer to you and will include you.in conversation . This is their way of testing you whether or.not you make the cut . What the cut is is te same for everyone and they all have the sane taste is music , fashion , ideas , everything.  If anyone doesn't meet this highly limited criteria they are marked weird and mocked . The criteria is so limited its like a military uniform . The core of their problem of self hatred is their consumer religion . They are soulless and they suffer unknowingly .  Small mindedness is q sign of unknown insecurity"
