  "dream_1": "Went to cocos exs house to say hi it was this bald fat man I baggy jeans. He lived in this strange mansion .first room was horror themed it had draped black strips of linemen hanging from the ceiling and axes and knifes as artwork . We went into another room with a gigantic photo of an Asian woman . He had another room with all of his artwork , coco wanted to buy every print which was 20 dollars , she asked to buy everything but I argued that wasn't a good idea as she didn't hAve enough money. , I said if she had a thousand dollars it would be fine : she seemed upset and I secretly bought a photograph print of the tshitt she was wearing (some band ) and went to put it. In the car . I considered that I bought the most boring thing I could have bought and regretted my decision. It was very hot . When I comeback coco apologisesd and said how weird it must be for me 'being her , and his pants are so flattering ' 'his pants are flattering?' Imagining his baggy pants which hung to the floor .. 'he's fat' she disagreed . We entered another room Where he was preparing a meal with an Asian women and 2 asian monk children . We left and me and coco fought as I was jealous and expected her to want to be with him",

<NOTES>
- The figure in the center appears to be balanced between two states or identities
- Shapes transform and repeat, suggesting movement and the passage of time  
- Negative space resembles a house structure, the "mansion" from the dream
- Circular forms evoke camera lenses, framing and distorting reality
- Recursion and self-similarity create a sense of infinite regress, like a hall of mirrors
- Stairs could represent ascending/descending through layers of consciousness or memory
- Repetition of "O" shapes might symbolize the Asian women and children, reduced to basic forms
- Tangled lines around the figure hint at confusion, jealousy, and entanglement
- Missing elements and broken symmetry convey regret and disconnection
