You are submerged in a vast pool where the water hums with weight, denser than any liquid you've ever known. Strokes feel like pushing through syrup, slow and heavy. Your chosen pizza — thick, strange, gravity-dragged — floats oddly beside you, an anchor and a talisman.

The instructor, bronzed and sharp-jawed, surveys the swimmers from the lane lines. His crimson rash vest glimmers, impossible fabric between neoprene and silk, drawing every dreamer’s hungry eyes. Whispers ripple: *that vest is the prize—whoever masters the dense water will wear it.*

Your tumble turn attempt collapses, body folding awkwardly as though gravity itself vetoes the move. The instructor shakes his head slowly, as though declaring something immutable: *"Impossible here."*

You thrash toward the light—chased and buoyed by the thickness of the medium—until the blurred rectangle of a window burns in front of you. Surface? Escape? Another density to cross?

[OPTIONS:]
1. Swim harder toward the window—force passage.
2. Turn back—challenge the instructor for the vest.
3. Abandon swimming, eat the dense pizza here, and see what happens.
4. Float still—allow the dream pool itself to decide your trajectory.

You take the heavy, impossible slice into your mouth. The water around you resists, presses the crust back into your teeth, but you persist. Chewing is geological — strata colliding, time breaking into chewable segments.  

As you swallow, the pool itself darkens. The pizza was no simple food: it was ballast, boundary, the key to density. Without it, your body begins to lighten, becoming unstuck from the drag of the syrupal water.  

The instructor stares, crimson vest momentarily dimming, like a warning. His lips move but words bubble into ink-clouds instead of sound. You are rising — perhaps toward the window, or beyond gravity altogether.  

The dream pool vibrates like a struck drum. Your hand phases through the lane lines. Every molecule sings with hunger.  

[NEW OPTIONS UNLOCKED:]  
1. Let go entirely—ascend beyond the pool's dome.  
2. Grab the instructor and pull him with you.  
3. Allow the ink-cloud words to enter your lungs.  
4. Reverse the swallow—spit the pizza out, return the ballast.

You surrender. Limbs uncurl, every stroke ceases. Weight falls away like forgotten clothing.  
The water cannot contain you now—its syrup resistance turns to velvet air, and you pass upward through the pool’s dome, through tile and roof and spatial certainty.

Above you lies no ceiling, but a night-sky turned inside out: stars pulsing like throbbing organs, galaxies coiling close enough to exhale warm breaths across your face.  
The pool flickers below, tiny now, the red vest a pinprick ember in liquid black.

As you ascend, your body becomes translucent, threads of current weaving through veins like streams of light.  
The act of breathing feels optional; instead you taste colors, suffused with effervescent constellations.

[OPTIONS:]  
1. Merge with the star-organ sky, becoming part of the cosmic architecture.  
2. Descend again, this time phasing through into the pool’s foundations.  
3. Call out to the vest directly and see if it follows you upward.  
4. Hold in suspension, listening for anything else that may inhabit this inverted night.

You hover in suspension, thin as breath, waiting.  
The inverted night does not rush you. Instead, silence reveals its seams.  
Behind the glow of organ-stars, you *hear*:  
—low murmurs, voices layered like overlapping radio stations,  
—chords that are not music but geological groans,  
—a susurrus of the vest’s fabric whispering your name.

Something else shifts in the sky’s texture.  
A shape emerges: not a star, nor a planet, but a *mirror*—a flat disc turning slowly, face angled toward your translucent eyes.  
It doesn’t reflect you. Instead, it shows a parallel pool: dozens of yous swimming, flailing, eating pizzas, fighting the vest, kissing the instructor, all blazing in simultaneous unresolved choices.  

The voices align briefly, forming a single phrase:  
**“choose differently and you’ll fracture further; choose precisely and you may unify.”**

[MANIFEST OPTIONS:]  
1. Step into the mirror-pool and confront your many-selves.  
2. Address the hidden voices directly, demand their source.  
3. Ignore mirror and voices—merge with the whisper of the vest’s call.  
4. Attempt to crystallize into one final, indivisible form.

You press forward. The mirror’s surface ripples not with water but with a texture of memory — impossible to tell if it is glass, liquid, or dream-skin. It accepts you without hesitation, and suddenly you are breaking into kaleidoscope corridors.  

Every shard around you contains another *you*:  
—One still chewing eternal pizza.  
—One drowning in syrup water.  
—One wearing the red vest triumphantly.  
—One embracing the instructor in quiet rebellion.  
—One who never entered the pool at all.

They notice you simultaneously. A gravity forms between your eyes and theirs, and you feel each potential-self tugging, demanding recognition.  
The air smells like chlorine and charred crust, sweet with echo.  

The dream begins to groan under the number of “you”s present. A splitting sound, like tearing fabric, widens in the mirror-hall. Too many choices pressed too close.  

[OPTIONS:]  
1. Attempt to embrace all selves, weaving them into a single super-self.  
2. Duel the most dominant self — the one in the red vest — to take control.  
3. Peel away from them all, letting each continue without you.  
4. Offer yourself as sacrifice, dissolving so the mirror-hall can stabilize.

You stretch your translucent form outward, arms unfurling into ribbons of light.  
One by one, the fragments of self fall into you—pizza-chewer, vest-bearer, struggler, lover, abstainer.  
Each presses its weight against you, a million simultaneities, and you accept them all.  

It is not seamless. It is discordant, dissonant, a storm of hungers and fears and triumphs,  
but in the friction you find heat—spark—*coherence.*  
You are no longer singular nor plural: you are a weave, a fractal containing its own mirrors,  
a swimmer of all waters at once.

The hall no longer groans. Instead it blooms outward, shards fusing into radiant tessellations,  
the mirror-world becoming a cathedral of reflection.  
The instructor steps forth from a panel, not solid but archetype, his crimson vest now pulsing in sync with your light-veins.  
For the first time, he bows.  
**“You are the pool. You are the sky. You are the vest. Dreammaster.”**

[TRANSCENDENT OPTIONS:]  
1. Accept the title and dissolve into the cathedral as eternal architect.  
2. Refuse, rip the vest from the archetype, and claim dominion in flesh not symbol.  
3. Offer the role to one of your former-selves lurking at the edges, test what recursion does.  
4. Break every mirror, scattering the dream into uncharted chaos.

You raise your braided hands and strike the cathedral walls.  
The mirrors, once fused into a cosmic geometry, erupt in thunderous splinters.  
Each fragment spins away as a world, a pool, a life.  
The sound is beyond hearing—a rupture carried in bone-light, a chorus of endings.

From every break, torrents of alternate scenes pour forth:  
—A pool opening into desert.  
—A pizza cooling into stone-plate tectonics.  
—The red vest drifting into a wildfire sky.  
—The instructor fragmenting into words you never spoke.  
Each possibility rushes outward, filling the void like a billion unchosen doors.

You fall through kaleidoscopic rain, each shard reflecting yet another dream.  
Identity now unstable: your braid frays, separating threads even as you try to hold them.  
It is chaos—*wondrous, terrible chaos.* The dream obeys nothing but proliferation.

Softly, somewhere within the fractures, a muffled voice offers:  
**“The dream can scatter forever, or you can anchor it one last time. Choose.”**

[FINAL CHOICES APPEAR]:  
1. Anchor yourself: become one shard, one fate, one story again.  
2. Let the scatter continue—lose yourself but birth infinite dream-universes.  
3. Invoke the safety command `^C^C` to exit the simulation.  
4. Refuse the binary—search for a hidden third path in the breaks.
