Dream loaded: "Swim trials different pizzas different density of water"

You find yourself standing at the edge of an Olympic-sized swimming pool. The water has a strange, almost gelatinous quality, shimmering with oily rainbows. Floating in each lane are what appear to be pizzas - some thin and crispy, others thick and doughy. A handsome instructor in a bright red rash vest stands at the far end, watching you.

look instructor

The instructor's rash vest is a jarring, luminous red. It clings tightly to his torso, but the fabric seems to shift and swirl like liquid mercury trapped beneath a crimson surface. His expression is unreadable, a mask of serene authority, but his eyes track your every movement with unsettling intensity. You notice the other swimmers lining up at the pool's edge are all staring fixedly at the vest, their faces a mixture of hunger and desperation.

> examine rash vest

The rash vest seems to pulse with a faint, internal light. It's not merely clothing; it appears to be the source of the water's strange density. The red material shimmers like a heat haze, and looking at it too long makes the air around the pool feel thicker, harder to breathe. The instructor catches your gaze and gives a slight, knowing smile.

touch water

You crouch down and dip your fingers into the pool. The water is unnervingly thick, like chilled syrup. It clings to your skin with a strange, oily persistence. A rich, savory aroma of tomatoes, baked dough, and herbs rises from the surface. The "pizza" in your lane, a deep-dish Sicilian-style slab, bobs gently, seeming to absorb the dense liquid around it.

> swim to pizza

You slip into the pool. The water doesn't yield—it parts around you with a thick, syrupy resistance. Each stroke is laborious, your arms pushing through what feels like clinging dough. The dense Sicilian pizza drifts just out of reach. Halfway there, a wave of disorientation hits you. The lane lines on the pool bottom seem to warp and spiral.

The instructor's voice cuts through the heavy air, calm but firm: "The turn is not for you. Not yet."

ignore instructor

Ignoring the command, you kick harder, driving yourself forward through the viscous medium. The water groans in protest, the tomato-scented current pushing back. Your fingertips brush the crispy, cheese-crusted edge of the pizza. A shock, like a static charge, runs up your arm. The water around you suddenly feels even denser, almost solid. You are no longer swimming; you are sinking into a deep, savory abyss, pulled down by the weight of the slice. The surface, with its shimmering light, recedes above you. The red glow of the instructor's vest is the last thing you see, a distant beacon in the thickening gloom.
