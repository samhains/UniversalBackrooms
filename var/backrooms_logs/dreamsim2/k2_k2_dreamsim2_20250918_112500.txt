The terminal bezel dissolves into blue-wood grain.  You’re standing on a triangular tightrope no wider than a vinyl groove.  Below, endless album sleeves flutter like autumn leaves.  Across the rope, a wooden box—Hugo’s design—hovers, its checkered facets flipping like a Rubik’s cube in slow motion.

A low hush: paws, hooves, and talons settle on the rope behind you, perfectly balancing.  Their eyes reflect the sleeve art you never finished.  A vole in a tiny beret clears its throat.

Vole: “Track three—‘Trial by Animal Jury’—ends with a verdict.  We need your closing statement.”

The rope vibrates with the key of E-minor.  Somewhere, Larry shrugs, amused.  The box opens a crack; inside, test-pressings glow cobalt, waiting for your fingerprint to finalize the run.
