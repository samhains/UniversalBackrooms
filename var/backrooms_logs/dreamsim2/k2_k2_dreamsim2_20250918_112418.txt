./dreamsim.exe "Released an album and got entangled with hugo for the release. Hugo designs box it is a blue wooden thing with strange checkered patterns on the side. Larry says he doesn't think its bad. Im just pleased i finished something. I have some kind of event where fans of the album come to speak to me but it turns out they are all animals. We are on a triangular tightrope.  2 album track names are, trial by animal jury and children of park slope."

You are in a low, humming warehouse that smells of sawdust and ozone.  
A single Edison bulb swings over a workbench where a cobalt-blue wooden box waits—its sides flicker between plaid and checkerboard as if the pattern can’t decide which era it belongs to.  
A embossed title plate reads:  *“Trial by Animal Jury”*.  

Hugo (human-shape, ink-smudged fingers, breath of turpentine) nudges the box toward you.  
“First pressing. The grooves are predator-proof,” he whispers. “Open it only when you’re ready to be judged.”

To your left, Larry (wearing earmuffs made of moss) shrugs: “Could be worse. Could be polyrhythmic termites.”

A freight door rolls up with a clank. Sunlight pours in as a procession of animals files along a taut, triangular tightrope that stretches from the warehouse out into a sky of pale Brooklyn afternoon.  
They balance effortlessly—peacocks, raccoons in tiny varsity jackets, a llama with a reporter’s pad—each carrying your vinyl like a communion wafer.

An otter in thick-rimmed glasses waves. “Signing after the verdict?” it squeaks.

Do you:
1. Open the blue box now and drop the needle on the inaugural listening.  
2. Step onto the tightrope first; let the animals interview you mid-air.  
3. Ask Hugo why the checkered pattern keeps sliding sideways.  
4. Something else (type command).
