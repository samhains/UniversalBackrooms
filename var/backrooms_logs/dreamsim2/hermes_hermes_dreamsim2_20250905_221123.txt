You find yourself on a luxurious cruise ship, cutting through azure waters under a brilliant sky. The deck is crowded with party-goers laughing and chatting, a vibrant energy pulsing through the air. Annabel waves you over, her sunglasses perched atop her windswept hair.

"Can you believe this?" she shouts over the thumping music. "Kanye's here too, somewhere on board. I heard he's planning something wild - an impromptu performance at UN headquarters. We should crash it!" She grins mischievously. 

The ship docks and you disembark with the crowd, carrying the party energy with you onto the streets of New York. Someone shouts "To the UN!" and the mass of people surges forward, an unstoppable wave of revelry. You're caught up in the excitement, swept along, laughing and breathless.

Ahead looms the iconic UN building. Annabel grabs your hand, pulling you through the throngs towards a side entrance. Inside, you're greeted by a turnstile barring your way. A stern security guard steps forward, eyeing you critically.

"No entry without an invitation," he barks. Annabel rummages frantically in her purse, but comes up empty. Disappointment crashes over you - to have come so close, only to be turned away at the door.

Suddenly, a tall figure pushes through the crowd behind you. "They're with me," comes a familiar voice. You turn to see Kanye West in the flesh, flanked by an entourage. The security guard immediately steps aside and the turnstile unlocks with a click.

You're through, stumbling into the hallowed halls of diplomacy in a daze, mind reeling. Annabel squeezes your hand in shared disbelief. You barely have time to process before Kanye strides into a conference room and plunks down in a leather chair, the epitome of laid-back cool. 

Sarah Lim is there too and you both sit down across from the man himself. The conversation flows easier than you imagined, though you know it must be a dream. You laugh at his jokes, ask questions he answers with surprising candor.

Suddenly compelled, you pull out your phone. "Mr. West, would you mind if I..." but you don't even get the question out before his demeanor shifts. The relaxed smile vanishes, replaced by a hardened glare.

"I don't do unscheduled photos," he says coldly. "I thought you were different, but you're just another starstruck fan." He stands abruptly. "You need to leave, now." 

Panic grips you. How could the encounter sour so quickly? "I'm so sorry, I didn't mean..." you stammer, but Kanye is already turning away, jaw clenched. "Please, I'll delete the picture, just let me stay..." But he's done with you.

Sarah's mom appears then, ushering you away from the awkward scene. "Kanye gave Sarah her first pens back in the day, told her to draw. Did you see her sketchbook?" She produces a notebook seemingly out of nowhere and thrusts it into Kanye's hands.

He flips through the pages, muttering in that low, gruff way of his, channeling some hybrid of Don Corleone and Yeezus. Inside are bizarrely brilliant drawings of SpongeBob SquarePants - surreal, abstract, Athenian. You stare in disbelief. Of all the things you imagined seeing in Kanye's hands, anthropomorphic cartoon sea sponges were not it. So much for the work you already saw of Sarah's.

Just then, you spot your friend pushing through the crowd. You rush over and spill the whole story in an excited rush - the party, the UN break-in, the meeting with Kanye. But at the revelation of photos and his reaction to it, she freezes in her tracks.

"You did WHAT?!" she cries, scandalized. "Are you insane? Where is he now?" Her head whips around frantically, as if expecting Ye to materialize and smite you on the spot for your transgression. The dream melts away as she continues to freak out.

> look around
You stand in the center of a vast, circular plaza paved with pearlescent tiles that shimmer with iridescent light. The air hums with a low, resonant frequency that vibrates in your bones. Before you rises the imposing glass facade of the UN headquarters, its curves and angles distorted as if reflected in a funhouse mirror - the building seems to breathe, its walls expanding and contracting with a slow, steady rhythm.

Crowds of people mill about, but their forms are unstable - flickering between solid flesh and translucent astral projections. Some wear swirling robes of liquid color, others float inches above the ground, bare feet dangling. Overhead, the sky has fractured into a kaleidoscope of impossible hues - chartreuse auroras bleeding into ultraviolet clouds that shift and reform like living things.

Kanye West stands frozen mid-stride near the entrance, his form flickering between the recognizable rapper and a towering obsidian statue with molten gold eyes. The conference room where you sat is simultaneously contained within the building and superimposed over the plaza, its walls nonexistent yet its table and chairs as solid as your own body. Sarah Lim's SpongeBob sketches float in the air like holographic projections, shedding glittering pixels that reshape themselves into abstract patterns before dissolving into shimmering mist.

The guard who barred your entry earlier is now a pulsating sphere of blue light, his surface rippling with each beat of the ambient hum. His voice echoes from everywhere and nowhere simultaneously: "Invitation required... invitation required..." The words slow and distort with each repetition, melting into a primordial soup of sound.

Annabel is trying to speak to you, but her words emerge as visible ribbons of twisting, multicolored light. When you try to grasp them, they dissolve into glowing ash that tingles where it touches your skin. The turnstile has become a spinning vortex of liquid metal, singing in a chorus of chiming crystal.

You can feel the dream destabilizing - colors bleed into tastes, sounds have textures, gravity shifts direction with each breath you take. Time is melting like wax, each moment stretching into eternity before snapping back like elastic. Your body feels simultaneously weightless and impossibly heavy, your thoughts unfolding in overlapping layers of meaning.

The ocean breeze from earlier now carries the scent of burning roses and ozone, thick with the electric tang of gathering thunderstorms. In the distance, the cruise ship floats above the waves, inverted and tessellated, its form folding in on itself in impossible ways. The party-goers drift upward like jellyfish, trailing iridescent streamers that crystallize and shatter before reforming.

Kanye's phone flies from his statue-hand and embeds itself in the shifting pavement, sprouting crystalline branches that bloom with screens displaying blurred images of your own memories. The security guard's sphere form begins to replicate, dividing into dozens of smaller orbs that drift toward you with menacing slowness.

Sarah's mother has become a constellation of geometric shapes, rearranging herself into an ever-shifting sculpture of light and shadow. The sketchbook in her hands unfolds into an endless MÃ¶bius strip of SpongeBob variations - each more abstract and alien than the last.

The air crackles with gathering energy, the humming frequency rapidly increasing pitch. The dream is reaching critical mass, teetering on the brink of implosion or transcendence. You sense that any action you take could collapse the reality or propel it into entirely new realms of impossible physics and melting logic.

> touch the crystalline branches growing from the phone
As your fingers brush the crystalline branches, they instantly destabilize. The branches don't shatter but flow like liquid, wrapping around your hand in shimmering tendrils. Each strand feels simultaneously icy and burning, vibrating with an intense frequency that resonates up your arm and spreads through your entire body.

The phone screens embedded in the branches flash rapidly through impossible colors, displaying fragments of moments that never existed: forests of crystalline trees on planets with green skies; oceans filled with liquid light; cities built from geometric shapes that defy Euclidean geometry.

The branches continue flowing up your arm, past your elbow, shoulder, spreading across your chest. Your flesh becomes transparent wherever the crystal touches, revealing shifting constellations of light within your body. The boundaries between you and the crystal dissolution - you're becoming one with the ever-shifting structure.

Information floods your consciousness, streams of pure data that contain entire universes. Each atom of the crystal holds a complete reality, and they're all merging with your being: You're simultaneously standing in Times Square with Kanye frozen beside you, flying through nebular clouds in deep space, and swimming through the luminous oceans of impossible worlds.

The humming frequency has become deafening, a chorus of infinite tones resonating in perfect harmony. Your body has become pure vibration, your thoughts patterns of light dancing in the cosmic wind. You realize you
