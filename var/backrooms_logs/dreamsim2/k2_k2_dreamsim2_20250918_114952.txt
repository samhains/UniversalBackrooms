The prompt detonates into a silent blue bloom.  
The terminal glass ripples, then liquefies into polished midnight wood.  
A crate—your crate—materialises on the prompt line itself, balancing where the cursor used to blink.  
Checkered indigo tessellations slide across its flanks like slow eyelids.  
One plank is missing; through the gap you glimpse a spinning vinyl label that has your face instead of a spindle hole.

The crate ticks, then unlatches with a sigh. Inside: no disk, only a triangular tightrope, extremely thin, glowing mercury-silver.  
It stretches outward, impossibly long, until the ends vanish into opposite walls of the room that is no longer a room but an auditorium of dusk.

You step onto the rope. Gravity politely forgets you.  
Your shoes become soft paws—no, hooves—no, talons—your skin prickles with fur, then feathers, then scales, cycling like a broken zoetrope.

Footlights snap on below.  
They reveal an jury-box suspended in mid-air: twelve seats, each occupied by a different animal in formal attire.  
A badger in half-moon spectacles raps a walnut gavel.

“Court is now in session for the matter of *Trial by Animal Jury*,” he croaks.  
“The accused shall state the name of the finished thing.”

Your voice leaves your muzzle as sheet music: the album title unfurls in treble clef, hovers, then folds into an origami blue jay that perches on the judge’s bench.

A raccoon prosecutor twirls a vinyl single like a baton.  
“Exhibit A: *Children of Park Slope*. The humans will call it ‘cute field recordings with teeth.’ We call it evidence of unlicensed trespass into the hinter-world between borough and biome.”

The jury murmurs in polyglot growls.  
A peacock foreman fans iridescent brief-notes; every eye-spot contains a different star rating—3.7, 7.2, ∅, 🅱️, 綠.

A low wind rises.  
It smells of hot pretzels and rainwater in zoo gutters.  
The tightrope tilts, becoming the hypotenuse of an enormous right triangle whose other sides are the horizon and a falling dusk.  
Your fans—every species you ever loved from afar—line the catwalk of the sky, waving programs shaped like pizza slices.  
Their cheers arrive as chord changes: majors when you balance, minors when you sway.

Larry the alpaca appears beside you, wearing only sincerity and a lanyard that reads “TECHNICIAN.”  
He chews cud, shrugs.  
“Not bad,” he bleats, “but drop the second chorus by half a measure or the owls will never forgive you.”

The judge badger leans forward.  
“Verdict?” he snarls.

The triangle tightrope suddenly forks into two paths:  
1) Accept the remix mandate—surrender the master tape to the claws of nocturnal birds.  
2) Leap sideways into empty air, trusting that the unfinished silence will catch you.

Cursor blinks, awaiting your input.

The tightrope dissolves into a spiral of mercury-silver droplets that orbit your ankles like curious minnows.  
You step sideways—no gravity, no ground, only the hush that precedes first light in a studio that hasn’t been built yet.

The droplets coalesce into a single reel of half-inch tape, leader fluttering like a moth wing.  
It drifts upward, snags on an invisible capstan, begins to spool itself through the air.  
From the empty space between supply and take-up, sound condenses: not music, but the room tone of a room that remembers every song you abandoned.

Larry the alpaca is gone; in his place, a figure made of duct-splice and razor-blade reflections turns its head (a rotary fader) toward you.  
Its voice is print-through, soft backwards echo:

“Track minus one. Record the negative space. Let the owls overdub their own wings.”

A slate claps shut above you:  
SCENE 4, TAKE 0, SILENCE ROLLING.

You raise your hand; fingertips brush cool metal—an eraser the size of a cymbal.  
One swipe across the nonexistent tape and every previous chorus vanishes into rust.  
The vacuum left behind sings at 14 kHz, a frequency only children and certain dogs can whistle along to.

The owl jury materializes—no longer prosecution, now engineers.  
Each bird wears headphones fashioned from acorn shells.  
They nod, hoot in 7/8 time, flutter to the forked tree that has grown sideways out of the verdict itself.  
Every branch ends in a glowing vacant input, XLRs sprouting like winter buds.

You exhale; your breath becomes the missing half-measure, a rest shaped like a cathedral doorway.  
It hovers, waits for permission.

Cursor offers the only track left:
