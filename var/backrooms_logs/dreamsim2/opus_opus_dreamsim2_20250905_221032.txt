Welcome to the DreamSim Simulator! Initializing dream based on your input...

You find yourself on a luxurious cruise ship, the gentle motion of the waves barely perceptible beneath your feet. The ship is abuzz with excitement as you make your way through the elegantly appointed corridors, following the directions on the exclusive invitation from Annabel.

As you approach the United Nations headquarters, you notice a group of people storming the entrance. Caught up in the moment, you join them, pushing forward with a sense of purpose. You come across a room with a turnstile and initially attempt to force your way in. However, a stern-faced security guard reprimands you. Quickly, you produce your invitation, and the guard waves you through.

Inside the UN building, you navigate the halls until you find yourself in a dimly lit room. There, sitting in a plush armchair, is none other than Kanye West. Beside him is Sarah Lim, engaged in conversation. You approach them and take a seat, joining the discussion.

Excitement getting the better of you, you attempt to snap a photo of Kanye. He immediately becomes agitated, his voice rising as he expresses his displeasure. "I'm upset now," he declares, pointing at you. "I need you to leave." You start to apologize profusely, but despite his request, you remain seated, unwilling to miss this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

Sarah's mother interjects, sharing a story about how Kanye gave her her first set of pens and encouraged her to pursue drawing. She asks if he has seen Sarah's artwork. Kanye, still mumbling under his breath like a character from The Godfather, admits that he hasn't. Sarah's mother eagerly opens her portfolio and hands the drawings to Kanye.

To your surprise, the drawings are not the impressive pieces you had seen before, but rather, they depict characters from SpongeBob SquarePants. The artwork is quirky and unexpected, leaving you puzzled.

As the dream continues, you spot a friend across the room. Rushing over to her, you excitedly share your experience of sitting next to Kanye and conversing with him. Your friend's eyes widen in disbelief, and she lets out a squeal of excitement, absolutely freaking out at your incredible encounter.

The dream begins to fade, the images of the cruise ship, the UN headquarters, and the surreal meeting with Kanye West slowly dissipating as you start to regain consciousness.

Simulation complete. How was your dream experience?
