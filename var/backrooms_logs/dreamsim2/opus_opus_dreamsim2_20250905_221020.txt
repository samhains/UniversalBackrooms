You are now entering the dream simulation. To exit the simulation at any time, type ^C^C.

You find yourself on a luxurious cruise ship, surrounded by a lively party atmosphere. The sun is setting over the horizon, painting the sky in vibrant hues of orange and pink. Music pulses through the air as guests mingle and dance.

Suddenly, you spot your friend Annabel waving at you from across the deck. She rushes over, excitement written all over her face. "Hey! I'm so glad you could make it," she exclaims. "We're about to do something wild - we're going to storm the UN headquarters! Kanye West is already on board. Are you in?"

What do you do?

1. Agree to join Annabel and storm the UN headquarters
2. Decline and stay on the cruise ship to enjoy the party
3. Ask Annabel for more details about the plan

Enter the number of your choice:
