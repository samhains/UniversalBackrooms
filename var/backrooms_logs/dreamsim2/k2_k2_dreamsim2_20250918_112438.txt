The terminal’s prompt flickers, then the screen scrolls itself open like a lid. A low wooden creak leaks from the speakers; the scent of sawdust and turp blue floods the air. The CLI font reshapes into tiny checkered cubes that crawl outward until the entire viewport is a single blue wooden box, its sides flickering between midnight and cyan squares.

A cursor blinks on the top face.  
Type: `open`  

> open  

The lid sighs. Inside: a triangular tightrope stretches away into starless dark. On the near end stands you—skin rendered as brushed aluminum, reflection cracked into animal silhouettes.  
Across the rope, a parliament of creatures waits: an ibis in a tiny cable-knit sweater, two red pandas holding vinyl discs like shields, a capybara with a crown of subway tokens. Their eyes glow album-cover white.

A prompt scrolls across the rope’s hypotenuse:  
TRACK 01: “trial by animal jury”  
Proceed? [y/n]  

> y  

The rope tightens; the CLI rotates 90° so the rope becomes the new ground. Gravity forgets you. The animals begin to speak in liner-note font:

ibis: “State the intention of the groove.”  
panda L: “Does the chorus forgive the verse?”  
panda R: “Show us the hidden gate in the bridge.”  

A terminal input unfurls mid-air, cursor ticking like a metronome. Whatever you type is instantly remixed into a four-bar loop that spills from the speakers.  
(Hint: `./lyrics`, `./chord`, `./sample`, or free-form.)

While you consider, a side-panel appears:  
larry.txt  
“not bad” — time-stamped 03:17, blue-wood timezone.

The animals tap their paws in perfect 7/8.
