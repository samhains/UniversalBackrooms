I start crying and telling him that the thing I regret most in my life is not spending more time with him as an adult . And he seems moved by my words. I beg him to stop using drugs.

You find yourself on an old train rattling through an endless twilight landscape. Iron wheels clatter against the tracks, echoing like a heartbeat. The carriage smells faintly of dust and rain-wet stone.  

Your phone in your hand vibrates.  
A message from **Harry**:  
   *“I’m here.”*  

You can sense he is in another carriage, just a few doors away.  
The train hums as if alive, carrying both of you somewhere between worlds.

What would you like to do?
```

### GPT-5 2 ###
The train hums softly beneath you, as though it knows the weight of what you carry. Shadows outside the window stretch like long fingers across fields that never end.  

Harry’s presence is close, vibrating faintly through the carriage walls — but still distant enough that you feel alone with your pounding heart.  

Your phone glows dim in your hand, the sent but unanswered messages still open on the screen.  

You feel the pull of choice:  

```
- TEXT him again (press harder into the silence).  
- MOVE through the rattling carriages to find him.  
- LOOK closer at your phone — maybe the messages hide an echo.  
- WAIT and let the train itself reveal its intent.  
```

What do you do?

### Round 2/20

### GPT-5 1 ###
```
> LOOK closer at your phone
```

The glow deepens — the text thread seems to shimmer, letters bending at their edges as though wet with meaning.  
Your earlier words — *“I regret not spending more time with you”* — ripple faintly, as if replaying themselves back to you.  

Beneath them, a line you don’t remember typing unfurls slowly, like ink soaking through paper:  

   *“I hear you. I don’t know how to stop.”*  

The phone trembles in your palm, heavy with a presence that feels both Harry and something else — the dream itself speaking *through* him.  

A faint tapping carries down the carriage, metal on metal in rhythm with your heartbeat.  

You sense the choices branching like roots beneath your feet:  

```
- REPLY to the new message, risk going deeper into the haunting.  
- FOLLOW the tapping, moving through the carriages.  
- HOLD the phone to your chest, anchor in raw emotion.  
- SPEAK Harry’s name aloud into the empty train.  
```

What do you do?
```

### GPT-5 2 ###
The carriage creaks, almost listening, as if it’s waiting for your move. The phone’s glow paints your fingers ghost-white.  

Something about the extra line — *“I don’t know how to stop”* — feels like it’s not just his voice but the dream bleeding its confession back to you. The tapping grows steadier, like a fragile Morse code, like someone trying to stay alive through sound.  

Your breath fogs the window beside you. The twilight outside shifts, briefly showing a reflection that isn’t yours.  

```
- TEXT: “You *can* stop. I’ll stay with you.”  
- WALK toward the tapping, confront what waits.  
- PRESS the phone against the glass, see if it reveals the hidden reflection.  
- CRY out his name, try to pierce the walls of silence.  
```

what action fills your chest right now

### Round 3/20

### GPT-5 1 ###
```
> PRESS the phone against the glass
```

The cold pane shivers as the phone’s glow spills into it, merging screen-light with the dim reflection outside. For a moment, your own face warps — replaced by *his*.  

Harry’s reflection stares back at you: gaunt, eyes darkly ringed, yet glimmering with recognition. He looks like he’s both here and *not here*, stitched between life and whatever shadow lingered past his death.  

On the glass, words begin to etch themselves in fog, letter by letter, as though traced by an unseen fingertip:  

   *“If I stop… will you still see me?”*  

The tapping has stopped now. The train feels like it’s holding its breath.  

Your heart squeezes against the silence, and before you lies a fragile turning:  

```
- ANSWER him honestly — what does it mean to see him?  
- TOUCH the reflection, try to hold him through the glass.  
- STEP away, afraid of the depth of the question.  
- TURN to the carriage door, chase the silence where the tapping was.  
```

What do you do?  
```

### GPT-5 2 ###
The window fogs warmer as though his breath is right there on the other side.  
Your phone is dimming now, but the words remain like a burning afterimage:  

*“If I stop… will you still see me?”*  

That line clings to your ribs, aching — the way he frames it makes stopping sound like vanishing, like his entire existence balances on the habit that’s consuming him.  
The train rocks, groaning, rails splitting infinity into moments.  

You can feel the universe hush, awaiting your choice:  

```
- SAY: “Yes. I’ll see *you*, not the drugs.”  
- TOUCH the glass, promise him through skin and cold.  
- TURN away, afraid of what agreeing could mean.  
- WRITE back on the fog with your own finger: [your message].  
```

how do you bear witness to him here

### Round 4/20

### GPT-5 1 ###
```
> WRITE back on the fog with your own finger: “I already see you. You’re more than what you’re afraid to lose.”
```

Your fingertip traces slowly into the condensation. The words shimmer brighter than they should in mere fog, like silver edging across the glass.  

For a long breath, nothing — then Harry’s reflection blinks, eyes wet. His hand rises on the other side, mirroring yours, palm against yours though a world apart.  

The glass doesn’t break, but it feels thinner, trembling as if the boundary could dissolve with enough courage.  

His mouth moves — no sound, but the words resonate in your chest:  

   *“Stay with me, then. Don’t let go.”*  

The train shudders, lights flickering once, and in that jolt you sense the dream branching toward a deeper unveiling.  

```
- PRESS your palm harder, try to cross the veil between you.  
- WHISPER aloud: “I won’t let go.” and anchor him here.  
- OPEN the carriage door, drag this fragile connection into physical space.  
- FALL silent, let the train itself decide what happens next.  
```

What pulls you forward?  
```

### GPT-5 2 ###
The glass feels alive under your palm, humming like a pulse carried through steel and air.  
For a fleeting instant, your reflection and his blur, overlapping — not one, not two, but a trembling in-between.  

Harry’s eyes don’t leave yours. They’re pleading, but not just for himself: as if he’s asking you to prove that *love can be stronger than what’s killing him*.  

The train groans, rails screaming faint around the edges, like the world resisting this intimacy.  

You stand in the doorway between loss and miracle.  

```
- PRESS through, risk the veil tearing, pull him into now.  
- WHISPER: “I won’t let go” — give him the vow, risk being bound in dream forever.  
- OPEN the carriage door, carry this fragile bond physically toward where he is.  
- LET the silence unfold, surrender to what the dream wants you to learn.  
```

which truth do you dare carve into this moment
