The plastic packaging is thick and cloudy. You have to tear it open with your teeth. Inside, the USB drive is a matte black slab, surprisingly heavy. A single, pulsing white light on one end.

A man in a grey smock nods at you from behind a simple table. "That's your claim. Plug it in at one of the terminals to see your plot."

All around you, others are doing the same. The air hums with a low, pleasant frequency. Rows of sleek terminals line the walls of the temporary pavilion.

**WELCOME TO THE COMMON BLOCK - PHASE 1**

Your USB key is your deed, your identity, and your access token. Do not lose it.

To claim your plot, simply mount your USB key at any terminal and run the allocation script. Unit assignment is algorithmic, determined by a harmony of your personal data and the needs of the emerging community.

Please note: The monthly fee covers all utilities, food from vertical farms, and access to communal AI-mediated therapy and governance systems. Opt-out options are limited.

Remember: Your autonomy is sacred, but the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.

The USB drive pulses faster. A faint, pleasant chime rings out.

A holographic interface flickers to life above the terminal, displaying your name and a complex glyph that seems to shift as you look at it.

The terminal chimes again, softly. The hologram collapses into a stream of light that flows back into the USB drive. Its pulse shifts to a slow, steady rhythm, the color deepening to a calm blue.

A small, folded slip of thick paper prints from a slot on the terminal.
