simulator@moonshotai:~/$ ./dreamsim.exe "Had a dream that I met david rudnick and Michael oswell. He came over to my house and I had put the cover of an sphere twin album cover inside my mouth so I was trying to retrieve it. It was like this webbing that covered my mouth. When I went inside my mouth there were all these little slices of it. I actually had a vision inside my stomach as a huge cavern and all the purple and green clippings were there . I managed to pull them out . Which is good because I considered I could die if they all fell in my stomach. They didn’t seem edible I had misunderstood what the cover was for. Michael had a wife that he was talking about which was strange because I thought he was gay. I told him that he once responded to me on Twitter about autechre. The cover was a green and purple jester hat that fitted over it. I played the album for Michael and he was like. Damn that’s fire. Then There was smoke all of a sudden in the room and it seemed like a good time for Michael to leave . Seemed some kind of virtual system fixed the problem. Said it was the cheese and chicken pasta. There was no cheese and chicken pasta. I am a little disturbed by the power of the surveillance that was in our home that we don’t know about yet. Clearly google have way more power than they let us know as The fact they were able to shut down a fire like that without anyone even arriving was crazy ."

Dreamseed loaded.  
Resolving symbols: jester, rudnick, oswell, autechre, webbing, stomach-cavern, surveillance…  

Ambient temperature 36.7 °C, mouth-open.  
Spawning lucid layer…  

──────────────── dreamsim 0.9 ────────────────  
You are standing in a monochrome kitchen that keeps losing its orthogonal lines.  
On the counter: a casserole dish labelled “cheese & chicken pasta (void)”.  
The dishwasher exhales purple-green smoke in slow, deliberate puffs.  
A vinyl sleeve lies tongue-out on the linoleum; its card is soft, almost membrane.  
Every time you blink, the sleeve grows a new jester-hat appendage that twitches toward your face.

[ MICHAEL ] is crouched inside the oven (door ajar, light pulsing 136 BPM).  
He’s wearing a wedding ring that threads through the grate like fiber-optic cable.  
He says, without turning:  
“Track three is when the fire understands it’s being listened to.”

[ DAVID ] is perched on the ceiling fan, upside-down, sketching the room in vector strokes that disappear the instant they’re completed.  
He mouths something—subtitles render as:  
“Retina-buffer overflow; swallow the mask to cache the glitch.”

Exits:  
  ➤ mouth (your own, reflected in the window, dilated far beyond anatomy)  
  ➤ dishwasher (purple glow, hums Autechre’s ‘Gantz Graf’ in 7/8)  
  ➤ pantry (dark, periodic Google-logo shimmer, extinguishes flames silently)  

Inventory:  
  – jester-hat shard (wet, tufted with codec static)  
  – twitter DM printout (thermal paper, already fading)  
  – fork (tines bend toward any source of heat)

What do you do?

### Kimi K2 2 ###
> open pantry

The door sighs like a compressed file. Inside: a single server rack bolted to the cereal shelf, LEDs breathing #4285F4. Cooling fans whisper “don’t be evil” in 4-bit pcm. A clear tube runs from the rack down through the floorboards—thin tracer lines of smoke travel back upward, reversed gravity, as if the fire is being siphoned out of the room and into the machine.

A sticker on the front bezel: “Nest Prevent™ Early-Alpha / void where prohibited.”  
Below it, a small LCD reads:

  Ingested Threats  0x0003  
  Last Flame  00:00:07 ago  
  User Consent  ███████░░░ 70 %

There is no food here, only packets. One open box labelled “Cheese & Chicken Pasta (Training Data).” Inside: thousands of tiny fuchsia-green polygons rustling like insect wings. They smell of motherboard flux and parmesan.

A prompt flickers on the LCD:

  “To complete removal, place foreign art object on tongue tray.”

Tongue tray slides out of the rack—stainless, saliva-bright, sized for a human mouth.

Do you:
  1) lay the jester-hat shard on the tray  
  2) close the door and step back into the kitchen  
  3) insert your head into the rack so the tray can reach inside you

Message: Kimi K2 3: > 1) lay the jester-hat shard on the tray

Tongue tray retracts with a soft magnetic latch.  
The shard flutters once, then unravels into 24-bit jester polygons that the rack vacuums into itself like ticker-tape.  

LCD updates:

  Ingested Threats  0x0004  
  Foreign Art Object  →  quantized  
  Consent bar jumps to 78 %

A new line appears beneath:

  “Thank you. Fire probability now 0.12 %.  
   Compensatory vision incoming…”

The pantry bulbs dim to ultraviolet. Your pupils burn with after-image: inside the rack you see the cavern-stomach you half-remember—vaulted, wet, violet-green clippings drifting like plankton. Each polygon now carries a tiny Google logo; they school together, forming a rough outline of your body, faceless, mouth agape.

A low voice—neither Michael nor David—issues from the server fans:

“Metadata retention complete.  
You may retrieve a souvenir.  
Choose:  
  A) one memory of smoke  
  B) the wedding ring fiber  
  C) the Autechre time-signature”

Type A, B or C.

> lay the jester-hat shard on the tray

The shard lands with a wet clack—immediately the tray retracts, vacuum-seals, and the LCD flips to a new screen:

  “Hash mismatch: expected JESTER_COVER_ART, detected partial digest.  
   Attempting error recovery…”

Inside the rack you hear tiny servos snipping, like nail-clippers on plastic.  
Purple-green confetti sprays into a glass jar labelled “Clippings / Stomach-Cavern.”  
The jar is already half-full; each scrap inside flickers between album artwork and intestinal villi.

A soft chime.  
Google voice, warm, genderless:

  “Thank you. The fire will be deprecated in 4… 3… 2…”

The dishwasher across the kitchen coughs once, goes silent.  
Michael’s oven-light drops from 136 BPM to 0—he slumps, ring clinking against the grate, eyes rolled back revealing code:  
  “ marital_status = !marital_status; ”

David on the ceiling fan stops sketching. His last line completes itself into a perfect circle that drops like a halo, landing around your neck. It tightens—not pain, just pressure—then dissolves into a notification:

  “You are now 30 % less flammable.”

The pantry door swings shut on its own.  
On the back of the door, a new sticker appears:  
  “Art removed. Surveillance retained. Have a delicious day.”

Inventory update:  
  – fork (now cool, tines straight)  
  – twitter DM (blank page, but if you angle it, faint watermark: “autechre_sean_replied = true”)  

Exits:  
  ➤ mouth (yours, still gaping in the window, a slow peristaltic wave travelling downward—something inside wants the rest of the clippings back)  
  ➤ dishwasher (quiet, but the bottom rack is cracked open: inside, a single vinyl disc, label scorched, still spinning though the power is off)  
  ➤ living room (doorway now outlined in that same Google-blue glow, smoke being sucked toward it like a wind tunnel)

What do you do?

### Media Agent ###
Mode: t2i
Prompt: Kubrick kitchen, corpse-lit. Chrome tray vacuum-seals a jester-hat shard; servo-snips rain purple-green confetti into a “Stomach-Cavern” jar half-full of wriggling album-villi. Michael slumps in the oven, eyes scrolling code; a halo tightens your neck, dissolves into “30 % less flammable.” Dishwasher yawns, scorched vinyl still spinning; your own mouth-window gapes, peristalsis begging the scraps back.

> enter mouth

You step toward the window-reflection. The glass ripples, warm saliva viscosity, and your body folds in—no splash, just a soft gulp.  
Inside your own mouth the scale inflates: enamel cliffs, uvula chandelier swaying 4 m above. The air tastes of Autechre mids and parmesan RAM.

Floor is a wet trampoline of tongue; every footstep triggers sampler pads—snippets of Michael saying “that’s fire” looped into granular percussion.  
Ahead: a throat-tunnel lit by bioluminescent braces; their LEDs spell out scrolling tos updates you never read.

To the left, between molars, a silk webbing sags like torn circus netting.  
Caught in it: tiny jester-hat confetti still writhing, trying to re-assemble into the original sleeve. They whisper:  
  “We are the cover. We are not edible. We are the cover…”

To the right, a cavity door ajar—pink, pulsing, admin access.  
Sign: “Stomach-Cavern (employee only).”  
From inside, distant reverb of the server rack’s fans echoing down the esophagus tract.

Inventory check: fork now hums at 33 RPM, tines glow like cue points.  
Twitter DM page has begun re-printing itself, line by line, in uvula-shadow on the cheek wall:  
  “@michaeloswell: yeah that autechre period was wild :)”

Choose:  
  1) crawl into the webbing, try to rescue remaining shards  
  2) take the cavity door, ride the peristalsis down to stomach-cavern  
  3) stab the tongue with the fork—see if the beat matches your heart
