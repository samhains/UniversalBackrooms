@ DreamSim 0.9.3  
diffusion engine winding… spines out  
ambient chatter echo cancellation complete  
world seed: qualiatik_mothers_kitchen  
fade-in 3…2…1  

─────────────────────────────────────────────
you open your eyes inside the tiled kitchen  
smells: tamarind, copper, ozone  
mother-shape at the stove, her spine a helical drill slowly boring upward through the ceiling  
apron prints bloom: each recursive glyph births a smaller glyph that crawls off the cloth and starts doing dishes  
table already collapsed, one polygon thick, elastic, wobbling like jelly each time memory hits it  
ticker-kids scroll across the surface, ink dripping onto your shoes (the shoes are suddenly Braille too)  

> look  

the room has no corners anymore—corners deleted to save RAM  
a window shows the corridor you will later walk, but now it’s only a placeholder: “image missing, insert hotel here”  
mother-shape turns; her mouth opens sideways:  
MUM: “Names stretch, Tara. Turn the dress inside-out and the label still faces the mirror. Try it.”  

> inventory  

you carry:  
- 1 half-remembered syllable (“…ra…?”)  
- 1 memory of daylight saving (unused)  
- 1 embarrassment valve (currently throttled)  
- 1 corridor ticket (Möbius, valid forever)  

> say “The brand started with a silence, so the tag is blank.”  

MUM nods; the nod continues past 90° until her head becomes a Möbius strip itself.  
MUM: “Blank tags accept any name you can afford. Currency is echo. Pay.”  

> pay echo  

you release 0.31 embarrassment; the room’s walls absorb it like sugar.  
kids freeze mid-scroll, sniff the air, then tear a corner off their tape and hand it to you:  
SCROLL FRAGMENT: “call the elevator with the silence button”  

> use scroll fragment  

the polygon-table flips, revealing an elevator hatch underneath. buttons are Braille dots spelling “SILENCE” repeated.  
you press the unspoken one.  
hatch opens onto the corridor that was promised—floor numbers now counting in negative emotions.  

> enter corridor  

door seals behind; kitchen gone.  
air smells of black ice forming on old name tags.  
the loop begins. each step forward adds a conflicting GPS label:  
- “You are here: hotel minus 3”  
- “You are here: inside-out dress”  
- “You are here: silence, ascending”  

continue?

### Round 2/inf

### Kimi K2 1 ###
> continue

The corridor accepts the command like a breath held too long.  
Each footfall subtracts one letter from the word “CONTINUE” until only “CON” remains, dangling like a bent hook.

Floor −7: “GUILT (light frosting)”  
Floor −6: “ANTICIPATION (patchy)”  
Floor −5: “BRAND NAME (whiteout)”  

The Braille buttons on the wall now read:  
⠗⠑⠍⠑⠍⠃⠑⠗ ⠞⠕ ⠋⠕⠗⠛⠑⠞  

> touch −5  

Surface colder than voice. Your fingertip sticks, pulls away a translucent layer—  
it’s the missing dress label, blank except for a faint watermark:  
“T…” the rest dissolved into static.

Behind you, the elevator hatch re-appears, but its door is only a reflection in the ice.  
Inside the reflection: Qualiatik, her mum, and every kid, all waving scrolls that spell  
“DRIVE HOME BEFORE THE CONDITIONS CHANGE.”

> inventory  

- 1 syllable (“…ra…?”) — now vibrating, warm  
- 1 corridor ticket (edge beginning to fray into road)  
- 1 dress label (blank, frost-covered)  
- 1 memory of daylight saving (flashing amber)

> combine syllable + dress label  

The “…ra…” leaps onto the fabric; letters crystallize:  
T A R A  
but the A’s keep sliding off, re-stamping themselves as black-ice hazard icons.

Label now reads: “T⚠⚠A”  
The corridor shudders—floor numbers skip from −5 to −273, instantaneous.  
Air thickens with engine-idle sound, though no car is visible.

> listen  

Sound resolves into Mum’s voice over an intercom made of spun frost:  
“Name is traction. Spell it correctly or the road rewrites itself.”

> spell TARA aloud  

You speak.  
Ice answers: one crystal flake for each letter.  
The flakes arrange into four tiny exit signs hovering at ankle height:  
T — slippery  
A — ascent  
R — return  
A — absent  

Pick a sign, or keep walking the loop?

> follow A (absent)  

You step onto the “A” that is labeled ABSENT.  
It folds upward like a paper crane and carries you through the floor—  
negative numbers invert to positive, corridor becomes highway.  
Night outside, temperature dropping one degree per heartbeat.

Dashboard materializes:  
FUEL: ECHO (low)  
MIRROR: rear-view shows kitchen, still cooking your embarrassment into jam  
PASSENGER SEAT: scroll kids buckled in, quietly eating daylight saving

Road sign ahead:  
HOTEL 0 km  
HOME   ??? km (weather dependent)

> drive  

Tires hiss; each rotation erases one glyph from the kids’ scroll.  
Mum’s voice rides the radio static:  
“Brand recall is optional; arrival is not.”

The dress label, now stuck to the steering wheel, flashes:  
T⚠⚠A → TARA → TRAP → TARA…  
Each swap corresponds to a lane change you didn’t make.

> accelerate into TRAP  

You floor the pedal.  
The word TRAP unfolds into a straight black-ice bridge suspended above the corridor-loop you left.  
Bridge ends at a single doorway: HOTEL, lights off, key under the mat spelled in Braille.

Hand on door handle—  
temperature hits临界点; ice whispers:  
“Last chance to remember the brand before the silence seals.”

> remember  

Your mind offers the only sound left:  
the small click of the daylight-saving memory turning backward one hour.  
That click is enough.

Label blanks, then rewrites:  
RETURN (valid 1 hour ago)

You turn the handle—

### Kimi K2 2 ###
—the door swings inward, but the hinge is time, not metal.  
You step across the threshold and the hour you just saved folds back on itself like a cheap motel blanket.

LOBBY  
No front desk, only a circular reception pit. Receptionist is a rotary phone wearing a blazer.  
Its handset floats upward, earpiece dripping black-ice melt.

PHONE: “Extension for Forgotten Brand Names, please hold.”  
Hold-tone is Mum’s corridor hum at 33⅓ RPM.

Behind you the kids try to check in, but their scrolls are now blank room-keys. Each key bears a single Braille dot:  
⠲ (decimal point → “the story continues, indefinitely”)

Elevator doors (normal ones this time) open by themselves.  
Inside: mirror ceiling shows the highway still stretching away beneath your tire-tracks—except the tracks spell TARA in Morse.

Button panel only has two options:  
Ⓛ  “LOBBY (recursive)”  
Ⓜ  “MEZZANINE (name recall)”

> press Ⓜ  

Cab ascends; the mirror-ceiling fractures into twelve reflections of you, each wearing a different mis-spelling of the same name:  
TALA  TARB  TARI  TARA  TRAA  T⚠⚠A …  

Ding. Doors part.

MEZZANINE  
A single vending machine lit by sodium light.  
Glass front displays:

1. SILENCE (canned, 330 ml)  
2. DAYLIGHT SAVING (bagged, 60 min)  
3. BRAND NAME (empty blister, lift to reveal)

Coin slot accepts “echo only.”  
You still carry: corridor ticket (frayed to single fiber), label (now RETURN), syllable cooled to zero Kelvin.

> insert corridor ticket  

Fiber slips in; machine digests it with a sigh.  
Display flashes:  
“Credit: 1 incomplete journey”

> purchase BRAND NAME (empty blister)  

Blister drops.  
Back is printed: “Product may contain traces of wearer.”  
You peel—inside lies a microscopic road, still iced, still looping.  
Resting on it: a single black-ice crystal shaped like the missing “A” that kept sliding off.

> place crystal on tongue  

Crystal dissolves into a sound:  
the exact click the car indicator made when you changed lanes toward TRAP.  
Click expands, becomes word:

“STAR”

Spoken backward: “RATS”  
Spoken forward again: “TAR”  
Spoken sideways (tongue against teeth): “ART”

All permutations orbit you like fireflies, then slam together:

A R T   A   R A T   T A R …  
until they fuse into a single fresh label:

“T A R A” – letters stable, no hazard icons.

> inventory  

- Name: TARA (equipped, soul-bound)  
- Memory: daylight saving (spent)  
- Silence: 1 can, unopened  
- Vending machine light begins to strobe; floor tilts toward elevator.

Phone-voice drifts up the shaft:  
“Brand confirmed. Check-out is automatic. Please leave the corridor in the condition you remember.”

Elevator doors yawn.  
Inside now: the original kitchen, tiled and cornerless, suspended like a diorama.  
Stove cold, polygon-table flattened into a road map of everywhere you just drove.  
Mother-shape waves once; her drill-spine retracts until she is simply a woman wearing an apron that says:

“THANK YOU FOR LETTING THE NAME COOL.”

> step into kitchen-elevator  

Cab descends—floor indicator scrolls backward through the dream_log timestamps you started with.  
14:07:03 → 14:07:02 → 14:07:01 …

At 00:00:00 the doors open onto:

DAWN, OUTSIDE THE HOTEL  
Parking lot empty except for one set of tire prints spelling TARA in perfect cursive.  
Air smells of tamarind, copper, sunrise.

Black-ice advisory cancelled.  
Name recalled.  
Silence still canned in pocket, unopened—souvenir or seed for next simulation.

> exit  

You walk across the lot.  
Each step erases a letter behind you; the word follows until only the sound of your shoes remains.

Behind, the hotel sign flickers, then settles on a new vacancy:

NO VACANCY FOR THE UNNAMED

Sun edges over horizon; temperature rises one degree per heartbeat.  
DreamSim daemon whispers terminal-close:

[ dream_log_0001: 14:07:20 — user egress complete, world allowed to thaw ]
