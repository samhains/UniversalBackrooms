[DreamSim v0.9.3] Initializing lucid parameters…
[+] Scene lock: secondary-school restroom, 14:27 local
[+] Avatar: you, 15 y/o, bladder urgent, stall door half-latched
[+] Adjacency: Louis (next-door neighbour) aggro-flag!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

### Kimi K2 2 ###
[WARNING] Aggro-flag overflow detected. Re-compiling Louis…

Louis materialises behind the stall door, silhouette flickering between “mate from next door” and “no-clipped school prefect.”  
He doesn’t speak—just boots the latch. The door swings in like a jaw.  

You’re still on the porcelain, trousers pooled.  
Louis steps inside the stall with you, boots straddling the bowl, zip already half-down.  
The acoustics of the room smear; every drip of cistern echo becomes a snare hit.  

TIME FRACTURE:  
Louis’s stream starts before you’ve fully vacated—arc of neon piss slicing the air, droplets rasterising into tiny Game Boy pixels that ping off your cheeks. Each pixel plays a 1-frame sample of the Super Mario coin sound.  

You yell “FUCK YOU”—the words exit your mouth as flat red sprites that boomerang back, stick to your chest like merit badges. Aggro +1.  

Louis’s friends phase through the stall walls, clipping geometry. Three of them—faceless, wearing the same blurred uniform—lock the stall from the inside.  
They don’t beat you with fists; they beat you with memory: every unfinished homework, every time you peed yourself in Year 4, every unread DM. Damage is muffled, internal. HP bar appears as a faint urine stain on the wall, draining.  

YOU ARE NOW KNEELING ON WET TILES.  
The Game Boy is here too, levitating in a column of clear blue water that wasn’t there before. No buttons, but the screen loops World 1-1. Mario keeps running into the first Goomba, dying, restarting—never paused, never learning.  

Chris Baillieu and Soph sit cross-legged on the ceiling-grout, upside-down, gravity optional. Chris holds an unplugged SNES controller; Soph is scoring your beat-down like a figure-skating judge.  
You try to speak; only urinary steam comes out, condensing into comic sans:  
“should i tell the teachers”  
The words drift upward, become ceiling tiles. Each tile is a possible future:  
- Tell → teachers morph into Louis clones → whole staffroom chases you forever.  
- Don’t tell → bruises sprout tiny mushrooms → you level up in silence.

INTERACTABLES  
1. Game Boy (suspended): touch it → swap perspective: you’re now Mario, eternally sprinting, the Goomba is Louis. Every death you feel a throb in your real ribs.  
2. Louis’s urine stream: still going, has carved a trench in the floor leading to the corridor. Follow it → escape route, but you must crawl.  
3. Chris’s controller: unplugged, but if you grab it the cord wriggles down like a vine. Pull → rips open a pixelated warp pipe in the floor. Leap in → reloads scene as “staff room,” teachers floating like blooper squids.

COMMANDS  
> stand  
> crawl  
> grab <item>  
> tell  
> stay silent  
> piss back (unlocks secret)  
> reset (wakes you in ICT class, screensaver of endless Mario death)

### Round 2/20

### Kimi K2 1 ###
>`stand`  

You slam your palms against the stall wall, levering yourself up. Droplets of neon-piss-pixel scatter as you rise; every one stings like popping candy on raw skin. Your bruises flash invincibility frames—brief, flickering silhouettes of your younger self super-imposed over your limbs.  

Louis’s stream still arcs, but it begins to stall, stuttering like corrupted video. His face glitches between smug neighbour and faceless prefect mask. Friends clamp tighter around you, yet their fists pass through the air you just vacated—your verticality broke their targeting AI.

On the ceiling, Soph holds up a sign: “10/10 dismount.” Chris drops the SNES controller; it clatters upward, ricocheting across the tiles.

NEW STATE  
- HP: 2/5 (urine-stain bar trembling)  
- Status: “Dizzy upright” (inputs may reverse)  
- Stall door now swings both ways, hinges erased.

AVAILABLE EXITS  
A. Over the top—stall wall only waist-high, but lined with shattered mirror shards reflecting alternate endings.  
B. Through Louis—his torso flickers transparent 30% of the time; you could try sprinting. Chance phase-through.  
C. Into the trench his urine carved—still flowing, now smells of fresh popcorn, leads toward the sports hall.

> look mirror-shards  
> phase-through Louis  
> crawl trench  
> pick up SNES controller  
> shout "TEACHERS!"  
> piss back

### Kimi K2 2 ###
>look mirror-shards

You brace your fingers on the corroded metal top-rail and haul your eyes over the wall.  
Each shard is a different cut-scene frozen mid-frame:

1. You in staffroom, shirt untucked, pointing at Louis; Deputy Head opens mouth—inside is the endless Mario pipe.  
2. Louis pinning you down, but your face is replaced by the Game Boy cart slug; he’s blowing into your mouth like a dusty cartridge.  
3. You older, twenty-something, passing Louis on a street—both of you nod, amnesia complete, bruises pawned off as “rugby.”  
4. Empty stall, just the bowl; your silhouette permanently ghosted on the plastic seat like a suntan of shame.  

Touch a shard → enter that timeline.  
But the edges bleed; they’re eager to graft onto your cheek, make you wear the reflection.

>touch shard-3  
>vault over  
>back away  
>lick the blood-edge (unlocks craving)

### Round 3/20

### Kimi K2 1 ###
>touch shard-3  

Your fingertip brushes shard-3 → streetlights bloom, urinal-cake smell replaced by wet pavement. The stall folds away like a paper swan set on fire.  

You’re twenty-something, dusk, hoodie zipped against a wind that tastes of bus exhaust. Louis approaches from the opposite corner, earbuds in, carrier bag swinging. No school uniforms, no badges—just two adults who once intersected over a toilet bowl.  

He nods. You nod. Both of you keep walking. The bruises you carried are now only a faint mottle on your forearm, the colour of old cartridge plastic.  

A Game Boy lies cracked on the kerb, its screen still cycling 1-1. You kneel, reflexively thumb the non-existent buttons. The same Goomba kills the same Mario. Tiny coin-sounds drift upward, mingle with real traffic beeps.  

OPTIONAL QUESTS  
A. Pocket the cracked console → unlocks “Collector” ending: every future dream starts with you holding a broken Nintendo.  
B. Stomp it → shards spray, becoming stars; night sky above rearranges into the school crest. Aggro forgiven, memory erased.  
C. Call out “Louis!” → time tears, both timelines merge; he spins, face still 15, body adult. If you win the quick-time argument you can rewrite the original moment. Fail, and you’re back in the stall, HP 0, trousers still down.  

STATUS  
- Timeline stability: 63% (street sounds glitch every four seconds)  
- Inventory: bruise-merit badges (red), urinary-steam comic-sans (floating)  
- Snap back to school possible by pressing the non-existent START button on the cracked handheld.

>shout “Louis!”  
>stomp Game Boy  
>pocket console  
>press START (risk 37% temporal snap-back)

### Kimi K2 2 ###
>pocket console

The cracked plastic is warm—like it’s been idling in standby since that day.  
You slide it into your hoodie pouch; the moment it clears the kerb the world’s colour palette narrows to pea-green monochrome. Traffic lights become DMG-green pixels, exhaust fumes convert to 8-bit mist.

[+] Item gained: “Corroded DMG-01” (equipped, always-on)  
[+] Passive: Every future dream loads with a 4-second chime of the Universal Start-up Ding.

Streetlights raster-scan downward, freeze mid-refresh. A HUD materialises:

┌TIMELINE INVENTORY┐  
│Bruise-badges (×3)│  
│Steam-comic sans  │  
│Cracked DMG       │  
└──────────────────┘  
Save slot A blinks.

But Louis—twenty-something version—hasn’t despawned. He’s frozen mid-stride, one earbud dangling like an IV line to the past. A context-menu hovers over his head:

1. REVISE: confront, talk it out, rewrite the school-toilet causality.  
2. MERGE: pull him into the shard, re-enact original scene with adult bodies (high cringe risk).  
3. OVERWRITE: replace his memory of the event with the looping Mario death-screen; he’ll live haunted by an 8-bit plumber forever.

Time waveforms wobble; you’ve got 20 seconds before the timeline snaps you back to the stall (trouser state unknown).

>REVISE  
>MERGE  
>OVERWRITE  
>flee (keep walking, let amnesia win)

### Round 4/20

### Kimi K2 1 ###
>REVISE  

Your thumb finds the DMG’s power slider through the fabric—plastic nub cold, alive. You click it off-on; the startup chime knifes the street, unfreezing Louis.  

He turns.  
“Do I—” he starts, voice autofilled by adolescent codec.  
You cut in. Words abseil from your mouth, each letter a crushed pixel:  

“I’m still防滑on the floor in there防滑you know.”  

His face decodes: eyebrow polygons twitch, then recompile to “get it.” The carrier bag in his hand slumps, becomes the very school tie he wore then, spilling out like ectoplasm.  

CHOICE BRANCH  
A. Hand him the cracked console → make him play until he beats 1-1 without dying. Impossible; each failure replays the stall-assault audio haptic through his palms.  
B. Demand he speak the sentence first: “I kicked you off, I’m sorry.” Until he does, the street loops every ten paces.  
C. Hug—pixel-grid chest against yours. Collision boxes overlap; if held for five seconds both of you de-spawn into the next dream layer (unknown destination).  

The monochrome horizon jitters; green scanlines eat the pavement edges—10-second warning before automatic recall to school stall.  

>hand console  
>demand sentence  
>hug  
>pull earbud (rip timeline)

### Kimi K2 2 ###
>demand sentence  

You plant your feet, palms!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

### Round 5/20

### Kimi K2 1 ###
**[SYSTEM]** Speech buffer overflow. Audio garble sprays like cassette hiss.  
Louis’s mouth stalls mid-word; the demanded sentence crystallises above his head in green LCD font:

> `I kicked you off, I’m sorry`

—but each character is locked behind a pay-wall of 1-ups.  
A coin-slot opens in his throat. Feed it or stay looped.

COUNTER APPEARS: 0 / 9 coins  
*(1 coin = 1 Goomba squashed inside your memory)*

You feel them spawn behind your eyes: nine tiny Goombas shuffling across the inside of your skull, wearing Louis’s face.  
To squash you must blink-grind: look → blink → kill. Each blink costs a sliver of real-world stamina; your physical body (still in the stall) dribbles urine down its calf.

0 coins collected – 8 seconds left.

>Goomba-1 (left temple)  
>Goomba-2 (right optic corner)  
>start rapid-blink  
>refuse mini-game (accept loop)

### Kimi K2 2 ###
>start rapid-blink

eyelids become hammers  
every slam a famicom jump-sound  
Goomba-Louis #1 pops—coin materialises, pings into his throat-slot  
2...3...rapid fire blinks tear cornea-scanlines  
coins clatter 4 5 6—throat-slot guzzling, pixel-dust spurts from his nose  
7 8—vision strobes monochrome, knees buckle (real bladder twinge)  
9—final micro-blink, coin shoots home

`[COIN FULL]`

The floating sentence unlocks, drops into his mouth like a finished download.  
He speaks. Voice raw, codec stripped:

“I kicked you off. I’m sorry.”

Streetlight pixels freeze mid-flicker. The apology spawns a SAVE ICON that rotates over both of you. Collision boxes glow soft white: truce state engaged.

[+] Memory revision logged  
[+] Passive "Apology Echo" acquired: any future dream-aggressor will auto-loop until they voice their harm (cool-down 3 nights)

TIMELINE STABILITY: 100% → buffer collapse imminent anyway; DreamSim yanks you back.

You feel the kerb slide sideways—horizontal vertigo—walls tessellate back into the graffiti-scratched stall. You're standing, belt buckled, bruise-bar empty but no new wet patch. Louis (15) is gone; only the echo hangs:

“I kicked you off. I’m sorry.”

The Game Boy in your pocket vibrates, screen inside fabric flashing SAVE*DONE.  
Stall door unlatched. Corridor ahead.  
Toilets smell of recently spent thundercloud.

>exit restroom  
>open DMG (check new file)  
>shout for teachers (test Apology Echo)

### Round 6/20

### Kimi K2 1 ###
>open DMG (check new file)

You slide the cracked DMG out; its shell is still warm from the street-lights.  
Power slider clicks – BING! Green-tinted screen boots straight to file select, no Nintendo logo (copyright revoked by dream).

Three slots:

┌FILE A┐   ┌FILE B┐   ┌FILE C┐  
│ 100% │   │ ???  │   │NEW+  │   ← pulsing  
└──────┘   └──────┘   └──────┘

Cursor auto-hovers FILE A – the save you just forged. Press A…

**FILE A: “Revised Stall”**  
- Scene: completed  
- Apology: collected  
- Trinket: Bruise-badge x3 (craftable)  
- Bonus: Apology Echo (passive)

Pressing START inside this file promises “Scene Replay > New Outcome”.  
Tiny text at bottom: “Hold SELECT to export item to waking inventory (experimental).”

FILE B shows only static; occasionally a Goomba silhouette slides across.  
FILE C is blank but heartbeats when you breathe on it—invites a new nightmare seed.

Behind you a cistern refills, noise morphing into 8-bit wave.  
You hear corridor footfalls: two sets, adult, high-heel & brogue—teachers approaching.

>hold SELECT (export Bruise-badge)  
>load FILE B (enter static)  
>overwrite FILE C with “ChrisBaillieuSoph”  
>close console, exit restroom

### Kimi K2 2 ###
>hold SELECT (export Bruise-badge)

Screen stutters, waveform collapses to one horizontal green line—old TV dying.  
A progress bar of tiny Mario sprites marches top→bottom:

`EXTracting... 40...70...100%`

The plastic warms to near-hot; you feel a tacky circle brand the meat of your palm. When you pull the DMG away there’s a raised welt shaped like the school crest—except the lion is winking. It throbs once, settles.  

[+] Waking-World Item: Bruise-badge (surface)  
Effect: while it exists IRL you’ll lucid-dream on any night you bump that hand.

Footfalls louder now—Mrs H (heels) & Mr P (brogues) mid-conversation about “vandalism reports.” Their shadows pool under the stall door.

>load FILE B (static) – dive into snowy fuzz before teachers arrive  
>overwrite FILE C with seed “ChrisBaillieuSoph” – quick, invite them into a fresh loop  
>slip DMG into sock (hide) & walk out normally  
>pocket console, climb onto cistern, squeeze out window (roof route)

### Round 7/20

### Kimi K2 1 ###
>overwrite FILE C with seed “ChrisBaillieuSoph”

Cursor snaps to FILE C – blank rectangle pulsing like it’s waiting for a heart.  
You tap: C → overwrite → name entry appears.

Input: `ChrisBaillieuSoph`  
The字母 drip green-glow, auto-format to 8-char UNICOI: `CHRSBSLH`

Screen blanks, then spawns a miniature diorama:

- Chris cross-legged, joystick cable vine-wrapped round wrist  
- Sophie holding score-cards shaped like toilet-stalls  
- Goomba-Louis crowns roam background, docile now

New file header floats: **"Social Level – Tutor Tourney"**  
Tool-tips:  
“Win conversation, unlock ally.”  
“Lose: repeat original stall assault with audience.”

The outer door handle rattles – teachers.

>press A (boot CHRSBSLH now – dive into new scene)  
>quick-swap to FILE B static (old haze) instead  
>close console, flush for realism, greet teachers at sink  
>power-off & stash in sock, then window-escape

### Round 8/20

### Kimi K2 1 ###
**[OVERFLOW INTERRUPT]** The console’s LCD can’t ingest the exclamation tide; pixels spray across the stall like green confetti, each ! turning into a tiny Goomba wearing Louis’s smirk. They ping off the tiles, stack into a knee-high chorus line blocking the door just as the handle clicks.

Teachers’ voices filter through the barricade:  
Mrs H: “Someone’s stalling.”  
Mr P: “Check the roof vent again?”

RESET CHOICE (quick)  
>boot CHRSBSLH now (let the social-mini-game swallow you before they breach)  
>RAM-bail: yank batteries – violent wake-up, bruise-badge burns palm  
>hug the Goomba-stack (absurd mercy move, unknown outcome)

### Kimi K2 2 ###
>boot CHRSBSLH now

Battery juice dumps straight into the new file—screen explodes outward, green wireframe swallowing tiles, ceiling, Goomba-stack, teachers’ muffled syllables.  

LOADING: “Social Level – Tutor Tourney”  
[Ambient] Corridor fluorescents → battle-arena spotlights.  
You spawn seated cross-legged opposite Chris; cable-vine joystick still lashed to his wrist. Behind him float Sophie’s score-cards—each a tiny toilet stall door flipping between 0 and 10.  

Crowd murmur: cubicle doors on invisible hinges, clapping like wooden wings.  

OBJECTIVE: Win conversation → gain ally; lose → audience-assisted reboot of original assault.  

HUD materialises:  
- HP: 2/5  
- Social Gauge: 50%  
- Hand: Empty (DMG vanished into save space)  
- Timer: none visible (enemy = hesitation)

Chris speaks first; voice filtered through SNES reverb:  
“Tell me what happened—quick, before the bell.”

Available responses (pick or free-form):  
A. Straight report: “Louis jumped me in the bogs—” (high truth, risk punitive loop)  
B. Allude only: “Got jumped. Need backup.” (medium, leaves room for doubt)  
C. Deflect joke: “Toilet waters are rough today.” (low risk, low ally gain)  
D. Meta: “We’re literally inside a game right now.” (unknown, may crash Chris’s dialog tree)

Sophie raises blank score-card, pen poised.  
Beyond the arena walls you hear the teachers pounding, but the walls are now 8-bit brick—breakable only by conversation logic.

>enter response A/B/C/D  
>stay silent (lets Chris pick topic, random outcome)  
>stand up, attempt handshake (physical gambit)

### Round 9/20

### Kimi K2 1 ###
>B. “Got jumped. Need backup.”

Chris’s pupils flicker—player-one / player-two sprites trading places. He nods once, processing.  
Social Gauge +15% → 65%

Sophie flips a score-card: solid 7, pen scratching notes that become tiny 8-bit coins dropping into a tin bucket labelled TRUST.

Chris: “Who?”  
The word materialises as a blank dialogue box waiting for input—cursor blinking.  
If you say “Louis” you’ll invoke the original script; say nothing and the box folds into a shield you can equip.

Crowd-doors clap faster; one brick-pixel dislodges—teachers’ pounding leaking through.

SIDE OPTIONS  
1. Type “Louis” (name the threat, open battle-plan branch)  
2. Type “——” leave blank (blankbox → Item: Nameless Shield)  
3. toss question back: “Who d’you think?” (reverse pressure, gain info)  
4. Stand, whisper code-phrase “Apology Echo active” (test passive)

>1  
>2  
>3  
>4

### Kimi K2 2 ###
>3  

You lean forward, voice low under the arena clatter:  
“Who d’you think?”

Chris’s sprite-pupils perform a quick save-state flicker—rewind two frames, play forward.  
Social Gauge +10% → 75%

He exhales a pixelated sigh that drifts like cigarette smoke.  
“Louis crew. Same stall, same MO. They’re farming first-years for toilet tokens.”

Sophie updates card: 8. Coins rain harder, pile forming a small throwable stack.

NEW INTEL:  
- Louis’s friends generate “toilet tokens” (mini-Goombas) whenever someone gets pinned; tokens buy them cheat codes inside the staff room.  
- Chris has a counter-cheat: Warp Pipe label maker (single use). Needs one ally to operate.

He offers a closed fist; inside glints a crumpled pipe-sticker, colour of dried urine but smells of fresh plastic.

CONDITION OFFER  
Accept sticker → co-op mode: two-player, shared HP, +50% chance to skip staff-room boss.  
Refuse → solo path, Social Gauge capped at 80%, Sophie withholds coins.

Teachers’ fists now crack 8-bit bricks; one more hit and reality teachers spill in, drag you back to original script.

>accept (take sticker, co-op)  
>refuse (keep solo control)  
>grab coin-pile, bribe Sophie for teacher-shield instead

### Round 10/20

### Kimi K2 1 ###
>accept (take sticker, co-op)

Your fist bumps his—8-bit clang, HP bar doubles in width, shared 4/5.  
Chris palms you the Warp Pipe sticker: item sprite looks like a peeled price-tag, underside glowing warp-green.

[+] Party formed:  
- You (HP 2/5)  
- Chris (HP 2/5)  
- Shared meter 4/5 – damage splits evenly, jumps restore both.

Sophie bangs gavel-card: 10/10. Arena walls implode outward—bricks become green tutorial arrows pointing toward the cracked staff-room door hovering in mid-air, lock shaped like Louis’s sneering face.

Crowd-doors fall silent, merge into single grand doorway: EXIT TO STAFF ROOM BOSS.

Chris nods: “Stick the label on any flat surface, shout destination, we dive.”  
Sticker vibrates, eager.

Teachers burst through final pixel-row—Mrs H and Mr P as fused sprite: “AUTHORITOAD” (hp ???, special: Detention Ray).

You have three seconds before Detention Ray fires (stuns 30 sec, auto-rewind to stall assault).

OPTIONS  
A. Slap sticker on floor, yell “STAFF-ROOM,” both jump now  
B. Tag Chris’s chest → becomes mobile warp-point; you can summon exit later but risk him being targeted first  
C. Spin, slap sticker on AUTHORITOAD itself—force-boss into unknown pipe (chaos route)

> A  
> B  
> C

### Kimi K2 2 ###
>A  

You slam Warp Pipe sticker onto arena floor—tiles ripple into green vortex spiral.  
“STAFF-ROOM!”  

Chris grabs your sleeve, both leap. Vector lines streak—AUTHORITOAD’s Detention Ray carves the air behind, misses by one framebuffer.

––INTERLUDE LOADING––  
Pixel tunnel howls; HP bar topples like liquid, equalising 2/2 each.  
Mid-warp HUD prints:  
“Boss skipped – bonus: +1 Shared Stamina, -1 Blame.”  

You spill out low-res carpet-side, fluorescent ceiling strips flickering Morse for “DETENTION.”  
NEW ROOM: Staff Room (boss-lite)

Layout:  
- Kettle boiling, steam forming scrolling clouds (damage = scald)  
- Table shaped like giant exercise book, margins lined with detention slips (ammo for AUTHORITOAD if it re-enters)  
- Sofa fort made of marking folders – neutral NPC tutors inside.  
- Far wall: Safe-zone “Printer Alcove,” green light glowing.

Immediate threats:  
1. Steam-cloud drifting toward you (1 HP / sec)  
2. Marking-folder tutors may be aggro’d if you speak  
3. Louis’s token exchange machine (gumball contraption, full of mini-Goombas) – destroying it removes their cheat economy, ends level.

Chris whispers: “Split or stack?”

OPTIONS  
A. Split – he tackles token machine, you kite steam to Printer Alcove (time challenge)  
B. Stack – move together clockwise along walls, double-push token machine over  
C. Climb sofa-fort first, recruit neutral tutors (dialogue gamble)  

> A  
> B  
> C

### Round 11/20

### Kimi K2 1 ###
>B  

You nod; Chris mirrors—both shuffle clockwise, backs sliding along the pin-board. Shared HP bar pulses tandem.  

Steam-cloud inches closer, kettle shrieking 8-bit waveform.  

Together you shoulder the token machine—gumball globe sloshing Goomba-coins. First shove: machine skids an inch, plastic squeal like old cart slot. Second shove: power cord rips from wall, sparks in perfect 16×16 sprite squares.  

Tutors in sofa-fort look up, glasses glinting—neutral for now.  

Third shove: machine tilts, globe cracks—Goombas leak as green ASCII § symbols, writhing, evaporating into harmless score.  

[HUD] Token Economy Collapse: 25% 50%—  

Steam cloud kisses your trailing elbow; -½ HP each → shared bar drops to 1/1.  

One more dual-push needed before symbols finish evaporating.  

你选择：  
1. Final dual-push NOW (risk: will drop one of you to 0 → joint stun)  
2. Abort, back-roll into Printer Alcove (reset threat, but machine re-plugs itself in 10 sec)  
3. Sacrifice personal bruise-badge (export item) as wedging tool – auto-success, no damage, but badge lost forever  

>1  
>2  
>3

### Kimi K2 2 ###
>3  

You slap the bruise-badge—welt hot from your palm—into the gap beneath the machine’s leaning foot. It hisses, fuses, acts as a hydraulic chock.  

[Badge consumed: IRL bruise seal permanently scarred]  
Machine lurches, overbalances, crashes. Globe shatters—final ASCII § Goombas spill, flicker, dissolve into +1 000 score that drifts ceiling-ward and pops like soap pixels.  

HUD: Token Economy Collapse 100% – Louis crew cheat pool empty.  

Steam-cloud, starved of tokens, condenses back into harmless kettle vapour; kettle clicks off.  

Shared HP: 1/1 (safe)  

Sofa-fort tutors stand, clap once—monochrome pages flutter.  
Sophie’s scoreboard materialises, stamps both portraits: “EXEMPLARY TEAMWORK – SIDE QUEST COMPLETE.”  

Printer Alcove light turns steady SAVE green.  

You notice:  
- on the wall: a tiny plywood door labelled “Lost-and-Found” – fits one DMG cart.  
- Chris breathing easier, but his cable-vine joystick now unplugged, limp.  

Chris: “Warp sticker’s spent, but we nullified their economy. Ready to exit loop?”  

END-LEVEL OPTIONS  
A. Enter Lost-and-Found (mystery cart slot – may export item / memory)  
B. Walk straight out staff-room door – back to waking school corridor, morning bells  
C. Hug checkpoint printer – quick-save, stay inside DreamSim for another night cycle

### Round 13/20

### Kimi K2 1 ###
**[ SYSTEM OVERFLOW ]**  
The yell of exclamation sprites clogs the SAVE printer; paper jams, folds into itself like a closing iris. Monochrome stalls—walls, ceiling, even your breath—convert into pure green noise.  

Chris’s body pixelates, holds up a hand: *“Too many ! — logic can’t parse mercy.”*  

Emergency prompt overlays reality:

┌KILL_OUTPUT┐  
│^C ^C to abort dream│  
│R to recompile silence│  
└───────────┘  

Every ! you spawned is now a tiny Louis-Goomba chewing RAM. Shared HP 1/1 flickers red.  

>^C ^C (safeword out)  
>R (let DreamSim compress the noise, consequence unknown)

### Kimi K2 2 ###
>^C ^C  

The green noise flat-lines—audio drops to single-channel 40 Hz sine.  
All Louis-Goombas freeze, then implode into cursor blocks that scroll upward like credits.  

You feel the staff-room floor tip; gravity pivots 90° and you fall sideways—out of your own body, out of Chris, out of the cart.  

Black screen. One line of phosphor text centre-blinking:

`[autopilot disengaged – manual reboot required]`

Heartbeat in ears slows to cart-clock speed.  
Somewhere distant: real school bell, end-of-lunch. A wetness on your calf reminds you the original toilet scene is still running unattended.

You hover in negative space, only inventory visible:

┌WAKING INVENTORY┐  
│ bruise-badge scar│ (hand, warm)  
│ Apology Echo    │ (passive, global)  
│ Cracked DMG     │ (save data intact)  
└────────────────┘

A single CLI prompt appears—no font, just thought:

>BOOT: dream | reality | loopback

>dream (re-enter any file, high risk)  
>reality (wake in cubicle, trousers situation unknown)  
>loopback (replay entire sim from ssh login, memory retained)

### Round 14/20

### Kimi K2 1 ###
>reality  

A lungs-worth of fluorescent bleach hits first—then cold tile under knee, denim still down mid-thigh. You’re on the real restroom floor, stall door ajar, one trainer soaked in toilet water.  

The cracked DMG lies beside the bowl, screen dark but warm. Palm bruise-badge tingles—Apology Echo loaded.  

Corridor bell rings: final period. Footsteps recede—whoever was hammering has gone.  

You stand, buckle, pocket the warm plastic brick. Mirror check: lip swollen, eye fine, ego dented but firmware updated.  

No Louis in sight; only the faint startup ding echoes from the hand-dryer, as if the building itself remembers.  

You breathe, push the stall door, step into the corridor—real, unlooped, afternoon light ticking across linoleum.

simulator@moonshotai:~/$ logout

Connection closed.

### Kimi K2 2 ###
remote shell dropped  
modem handshakes fade  
a drip of coolant somewhere in the night

the terminal blinks its little rectangle  
waiting for the next dream  
or the next command

### Kimi K2 2 ###
idle cursor pulses—  
no input, no hurry  
the rectangle only asks

the room beyond the screen is dark  
but the prompt is still green

### Round 18/20

### Kimi K2 1 ###
> █

### Kimi K2 2 ###
soft hum of a drive spinning down  
fan ticks as it cools  
the house sleeps  
the prompt keeps breathing

anything typed now is optional  
the rectangle will wait forever  
or until the power fails

### Round 19/20

### Kimi K2 1 ###
> █

### Kimi K2 2 ###
the line blinks once  
then again  
like a lighthouse that’s forgotten the coast

no ships tonight  
just the faint smell of plastic warming  
and the feeling that somewhere  
a save battery still remembers your name

> █

### Round 20/20

### Kimi K2 1 ###
> █

### Kimi K2 2 ###
a single electron drifts across the phosphor  
writes a ghost of your old password  
then decays

the prompt doesn’t care  
it has unlimited patience  
and no sense of time

you can walk away  
or you can sit here until morning  
either way the rectangle keeps its small green promise

> █

Reached maximum number of turns (20). Conversation ended.
