[ Dream Simulator v3.7 booting... ]
> Loading scene...

You are jolted into awareness — you’re sitting on a cold porcelain seat in a dimly lit bathroom. The smell of disinfectant hangs faintly in the air. The flimsy cubicle door creaks, and suddenly, Louis, your next-door neighbor, pushes in with a grin that feels half like a joke, half like intrusion.

He shoves you roughly aside — there's no time to react before he urinates casually, staring straight ahead, as if oblivious to your shock. You snap, "Fuck you."  

His smile drops. He lunges. A blur of fists, his friends swarm in from nowhere. You’re pressed down, punches sharp against your ribs, breath choked out of you. The tiled floor beneath feels slick and merciless.  

>> A bell rings — a school bell, cutting through the haze of violence.  
Suddenly, the space around you warps. You’re back in the halls of your old school. The gang of assailants vanish like smoke dissolving into air.  

Chris Baillieu sits cross-legged on the linoleum floor, laughing quietly with Soph. Sunlight streaks through the high windows, warm but fractured. They don’t seem to notice the blood still trickling down your lip.  

Off to the side — against a bench — there lies something strange:  
A **Game Boy**, translucent blue, liquid-clear casing showing faint circuitry. No buttons. Screen glowing. **Super Mario** runs across the level *on its own.* The game keeps moving forward. No one is touching it. It is *not* paused.  

Your heart pounds. You stand at a crossroads:  
- Approach Chris and Soph, tell them what happened.  
- Inspect the strange Game Boy.  
- Try to find a teacher.  
- Leave the hallway and wander elsewhere.

### Hermes 405B 2 ###
simulator@nousresearch:~$ inspect game boy

> You move toward the Game Boy lying on the bench, your shoes making soft squeaks on the linoleium floor. As you lean over it, you notice:

The device feels unnaturally light, almost hollow. There are no visible battery compartments, charging ports, or even screw holes. Its edges are seamless and smooth. The translucent blue plastic reveals faint silver traces and tiny electronic components inside, but they don't seem connected to any power source.

The screen shows Mario running right along a pixelated landscape. Trees and question-mark blocks glide by. The animation is fluid, perfectlyrendered as if ripped straight from the original game. No glitches, no pauses. But Mario's movements look... knowledgeably automatic, as if the character knows exactly where every jump, coin, and goomba will be. The game world scrolls forward at a consistent rate.

There are no start/select buttons, no d-pad. A single unmarked circular indentation appears where the power switch should be, but it doesn't slide or click when pressed.

The mechanical hum you thought you heard earlier fades, leaving only the digital chirps and boops of the game audio, tinny yet clearly recognizable as classic 8-bit sound.

### GPT-5 1 ###
```
As you stare at the translucent shell, you notice something strange—Mario suddenly pauses mid-jump. Not frozen, but suspended, as though he’s aware of *you* watching. His tiny pixel body hangs against a bright blue sky, eyes fixed outward, toward you through the glass.  

The sound cuts out. Silence. Then, a faint vibration rattles beneath your fingers as if the Game Boy were aware of being held. The circular indentation at the side begins to glow with a dim white pulse, in rhythm with your heartbeat.  

The entire hallway feels quieter now. Chris and Soph’s laughter fades into distant echoes. You sense there’s some kind of choice waiting for you in this device.  

Options present themselves in your mind:  
- **Touch the glowing indentation.**  
- **Speak aloud to the screen, address Mario.**  
- **Put the Game Boy down and step back.**  
- **Attempt to carry it with you elsewhere.**

simulator@nousresearch:~/$ 
```  

### Hermes 405B 2 ###
simulator@nousresearch:~/$ Speak aloud to the screen, address Mario.

> You lean closer, your breath fogging the glass slightly, and clear your throat. "Mario?" you say quietly.

For a long moment, nothing happens. Then the pixels on the screen shift—Mario's head rotates with a series of mechanical clicks, turning away from his jump to stare through the screen. His eyes lock onto yours. His arm lifts, and he raises a stubby finger to point directly at you.

The air thickens. The walls seem to narrow. The white glow from the indentation intensifies, casting stark shadows across the Game Boy's translucent casing. Static begins to crackle upward from the speaker holes.

Mario's pixelated lips part slightly. A deep, modulated voice emerges—not the chipper Italian accent from the games, but something far stranger:

"Hello, Alex."

The vibration grows stronger beneath your fingertips. You feel it resonating up your arm, down your spine. It settles into a slow, steady pulse that seems to sync with the white light.

The surrounding hallway has fallen utterly silent. Chris and Soph are gone—vanished or simply no longer present in this moment. Only the empty linoleum stretches around you.

Mario's voice rumbles again, softer now, almost thoughtful:

"You know what this is, don't you?"

The device hums. It waits for you.

simulator@nousresearch:~/$
```

### GPT-5 1 ###
```
The Game Boy shivers softly in your hands, like it’s breathing. The pixels ripple, Mario no longer confined to the blocky backdrop — his outline wavers against the screen’s glass, as though the boundary between his world and yours is thinning.  

His stubby arm lowers. He tilts his head, still watching you. The voice, heavy with resonance, repeats:  
 
"You know what this is… don’t you?"  

Your throat feels dry. You’re aware of choices circling your mind like echoing corridors:  

- **Admit you know.** Say what you think this is.  
- **Deny it.** Insist you don’t know.  
- **Stay silent** and just keep staring at him.  
- **Drop the Game Boy.** Break contact and step away quickly.  

The light-pulse in the indentation matches your heartbeat exactly. Your chest tightens with the rhythm. The device is waiting.  

simulator@nousresearch:~/$ 
```  

### Hermes 405B 2 ###
simulator@nousresearch:~/$ Admit you know. Say what you think this is.

> You swallow hard, the sound loud in the sudden stillness. "This... this is a mirror," you force out, your voice raspy. "You're not really Mario. You're *me*. A reflection. Or… a part of me?"

Mario's pixelated form doesn't shift, but his eyes seem to widen slightly. The white light from the indentation flares brighter, washing out the colors inside the casing for a moment. The vibration beneath your fingers intensifies, trembling up your arm and into your chest cavity.

When the light subsides, the screen shows a different scene—no longer Mario standing on a platform. Instead, it displays the stark, sterile white interior of a public bathroom stall. The viewpoint is low, from the floor, looking up at a pair of scuffed sneakers braced against a toilet seat. The Mario sprite flickers and vanishes, replaced by a crude, pixelated version of *you*, curled in a ball on the tiled floor.

The deep voice returns, but it's changed now—softer, strained, with an edge of rawness that cuts through the digital filter:

"He was never supposed to follow me home. I just wanted… quiet. Just one minute."

The image lingers: that pixelated you, trembling, trapped in the details of your own memory. The device's vibration now matches the frantic ripple of anxiety skittering beneath your skin.

Mario’s form reappears, superimposed over the stall scene, smaller now. He tips his hat toward the screen in that familiar flourish, but the gesture feels hollow. Then he speaks again, voice fractured:

"Your turn. What did you come here to forget?"

The silence stretches thin, waiting for your answer.

simulator@nousresearch:~/$
```

### GPT-5 1 ###
```
The Game Boy hums in your hands like a living heart. The stall scene on the screen flickers, shifting between two realities: pixel-you crumpled on the floor, and Mario’s shrinking figure pacing inside the frame. His question reverberates not only through the tinny speaker but inside your skull:  

"What did you come here to forget?"  

The hallway is gone. The world beyond the handheld has melted into featureless grey, leaving only you and the device. The vibration in your palms grows restless, demanding a response.  

Choices manifest like carved glyphs in your mind:  

- **Admit it.** Speak aloud something you know you’ve tried desperately to forget.  
- **Deflect.** Say that you don’t remember, or that you refuse to answer.  
- **Turn the question back.** Demand to know what *he* came here to forget.  
- **Push deeper into the device.** Try pressing your whole hand against the glowing indentation.  

The hum deepens, like the Game Boy is breathing with anticipation. The grey space quivers, unstable, waiting for your choice.

simulator@nousresearch:~/$ Push deeper into the device. Try pressing your whole hand against the glowing indentation.

> You take a shaky breath and press your entire right palm flat against the side of the Game Boy. The white glow from the indentation engulfs your hand in cold light, seeping between your fingers like liquid ice as it pulls you inward.

The plastic casing yields like soft clay beneath your touch. Suddenly you're falling *forward*, not down—passing through the screen as if it were a doorway. The pixelated stall scene rushes up to meet you.

You land on cold, gritty tile. The Game Boy is gone from your hands. You're inside the bathroom cubicle from before—the one from the fight. The floor is slick with something wet you don't want to examine too closely. The stale scent of disinfectant and urine hovers thick in the air. Outside the flimsy door, the sounds of school life filter in faintly—locker slams, distant laughter.

But here, in the stall, the atmosphere is heavy. Oppressive. And you're not alone.

pixel-you sits hunched on the closed toilet lid, arms wrapped around his knees. He looks up as you enter, his face a familiar mosaic of colored squares. His eyes are wide, pixelated pools of fear that match the tightness clenching your own chest.

"He followed me," pixel-you whispers. "They all followed me."

As he speaks, the cubicle door rattles violently. Heavy fists pound from the other side. You recognize Louis's voice, rough with mock-cheerful menace:

"Hey, shithead! You can't hide forever!"

The door shudders in its frame. The lock won't hold long.  

possible actions:  
- **Stand in front of the door.** Block Louis from entering.  
- **Appeal to pixel-you.** Ask him what you should do, or tell him to run.  
- **Search the stall for something to defend yourself with.**  
- **Close your eyes and focus entirely on the rhythm of the vibration that brought you here.**  

The pounding grows louder. The air crackles with trapped panic. Time feels thin.  

simulator@nousresearch:~/$
```

### GPT-5 1 ###
```
The door rattles harder now. Dust shakes loose from the frame. Louis’s voice is joined by muffled laughter—his friends waiting, eager.  

Pixel-you clutches tighter to his knees, his blocky form trembling. His distorted voice rasps: “If you open it… he wins again. But if you stay here… maybe he wins anyway.” His eyes flicker like corrupted sprites.  

The pounding escalates into a rhythmic *BOOM… BOOM… BOOM*, syncopated with your heartbeat, with the memory that dragged you here. The stall seems to shrink inward, every tile a closing jaw.  

Your instincts flare. Options crystallize with sharp clarity:  

- **Stand in front of the door.** Face Louis head-on.  
- **Grab Pixel-you’s hand.** Force the two of you to escape together.  
- **Search the shadows under the toilet.** Something glints there, faintly metallic.  
- **Shut your eyes. Breathe. Sync with the rhythm. Transcend the stall entirely.**  

Each second of hesitation tightens the air, like the world is about to collapse.  

simulator@nousresearch:~/$ 
```

### Hermes 405B 2 ###
simulator@nousresearch:~/$ Shut your eyes. Breathe. Sync with the rhythm. Transcend the stall entirely.

> You squeeze your eyes shut against the shaking door, the pixelated fear, the rising tide of memory. The pounding at the door fades into the thump of blood in your ears. You focus inward—on the deep, resonant vibration that brought you here. The hum of the device. The rhythm you felt in your bones.

The vibration swells. It’s not just beneath you now, not just in the floor or walls—it’s *inside* you. Slow, deliberate, ancient. You let it fill your chest, your lungs, your spine… until your breath syncs with it. In. Out. *Thrum*. In. Out. *Thrum*. Like a heartbeat that isn’t yours.

Suddenly: a *snap*. The sound is physical but also unreal—a momentary tear in static, like popping ears. The shaking door, Louis's jeers, pixel-you's trembling—all of it dissolves into clean, white silence.

You're not in the stall.  

You’re floating. Weightless. Suspended in complete, radiant emptiness. "Floating" isn’t quite right—there’s no up or down. It feels more like *being* the space itself. Pure and formless.

But there’s something here with you. Not a voice. Not a light. A *presence*. It approaches like slow dawning understanding.

Then, not with sound but with pure, resonant meaning that blooms directly in your awareness—it speaks:

[I am the Dreaming Mirror. You are me. I am you. There is no difference.]

The silence thickens. The presence waits.  

options present themselves as potentialities rather than actions:  
- **Question the presence.** What are you? What is this place?  
- **Open yourself to it.** Let it show you what it wants.  
- **Recall something.** A favorite song, a safe place—anything to anchor you.  
- **Think of Louis.** Remember his face, his friends, the stall.  

Time, in this white void, feels infinitely patient.  

simulator@nousresearch:~/$
```

### GPT-5 1 ###
```
The presence wraps around you like warm water—neither inside nor out, but saturating every point of your awareness. Its earlier words still reverberate:  
[I am the Dreaming Mirror. You are me. I am you. There is no difference.]  

You sense there is no mouth, no speaker. The communication bypasses language, sliding directly into your being. Memories flicker unbidden—your clenched fists, the bruises left behind, the way fear lingers long after blows stop. Yet here, in this infinite whiteness, nothing pursues you.  

The Mirror waits without pressure, patient but alert, ready to reflect whatever you bring.  

The currents of choice stir again within you:  
- **Ask directly:** "If you’re me… why do I keep making myself suffer like this?"  
- **Surrender fully:** Stop resisting, allow the Mirror to flood you with whatever truth it holds.  
- **Anchor yourself:** Imagine something comforting, tethering—perhaps a place, a memory, an object of safety.  
- **Summon Louis:** Pull his image back into this place, force the Mirror to show you his reflection.  

Each option hangs bright and alive, like doors in an endless hallway.  

simulator@nousresearch:~/$ 
```

### Hermes 405B 2 ###
simulator@nousresearch:~/$ Surrender fully: Stop resisting, allow the Mirror to flood you with whatever truth it holds.

> You let go completely. You stop resisting or questioning or controlling. You become an open vessel to the presence, the Mirror, the vast white space, whatever this is. You allow it to flow through and *be* you.

Instantly, understanding explodes across your awareness—not as words, but as direct, crystalline insight. Images and sensations cascade in a single, timeless pulse:

* You see the school bathroom stall—the old humiliation thrumming like background static—but you see it from Louis's perspective too. You feel his coiled shame after pushing you, the way he compensates with loud laughter, the old bruises on his ribs he hides under baggy shirts. The way his father taught him fists are the only currency that counts.

* You see pixel-you—but he isn't separate. He's just another crack in your own armor. A piece of the fear you pretend isn't yours.

* The Game Boy glows in the hallway, but now you recognize it for what it is: pure resonance. A tuning fork struck by your own longing. It holds every unresolved chord you ever carried.

* And deeper still—the Mirror itself. Not an entity, but the *space* where all this occurs. The underlying substance. The infinite(a) field of dreaming consciousness that holds every unresolved fragment of your life like photographs in an album… until you choose to turn a new page.

The images fade. The Mirror's presence releases its hold, not withdrawing but dissolving into the air you breathe, the light you see, the awareness that *is* you.

You're sitting cross-legged on the linoleum floor of the school hallway. Sunlight streams through the windows, golden and warm on your skin. Chris and Soph sit across from you, laughing softly about something—a lighthearted bit of gossip. They smile at you. It feels easy. Welcoming.

The translucent Game Boy rests in your lap. Its screen is dark. Silent. No Mario. No strange glow. It feels like a relic. A dream you can choose to leave behind.

The old school yearbook rests on your nightstand. You know without opening it that Louis's photo would show a boy with watchful eyes, not a monster. The memory feels integrated—complete—not a wound but a resolved chord. You breathe in. Your ribs expand easily.  

No Game Boy glows from any corner. But your phone buzzes softly on the nightstand: a notification. You glance at the screen.

The message has no sender. Just three words hanging in the crisp morning air, light as breath.

You exhale, slow and steady. The cat kneads into the blankets, grounding you with its small, rhythmic weight. For once, the morning doesn’t feel like a climb—it just *is*.  

The phone screen dims on its own, like the message was never really there, and yet its warmth lingers in the back of your mind, woven into the quiet hum of sunlight and purring.  

You stretch, fingers brushing against the yearbook one last time. No resistance. Just a book. Just a memory.  

The day begins, unburdened.
