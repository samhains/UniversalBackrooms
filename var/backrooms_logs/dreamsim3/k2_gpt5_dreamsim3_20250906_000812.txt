—— foyer ——  
fluorescent lights buzz like cicadas. escalators thrum in lock-step; shoppers swing carrier-bags like rifles. a tannoy crackles: “Attention: today only, power is on special.”

Inventory:  
- MacBook Air (yours, inside soft grey sleeve)  
- wallet (thin, three cards)  
- phone (12 %, silent)  
- loyalty stub: “Myers” hologram shimmers

Coco stands at the PS1 demo kiosk, crash-bandicoot looping.  
Her mum taps platinum card on the counter,节拍 perfect, 4/4.  
Receipt printer chirps: $390.00—SALE FINAL.

npc> Coco: “It’s the grey one, five games bundled. Mum says it’s an investment.”  
npc> Mum: (smiles without pupils) “Gifts are anchors, darling.”

—— available verbs ——  
(negotiate | pocket | swap | escort | inspect | steal | wake)

> swap  
You slide your MacBook out, open the clamshell just enough to show chrome.  
“Look, I’ve got the same library at home—backward-compatible. Let’s trade this receipt for store credit, keep the peace.”

Coco blinks; the kiosk lights pixelate—briefly the console becomes an aquarium of polygons.  
Mum’s card pulses like a metronome.

system prompt: “Return window closes when the marching band reaches housewares.”  
distant drums: left, left, left-right-left.

> negotiate  
You flag a red-vested returns clerk.  
His name-tag flickers: “Hi, I’m ???”  
npc> Clerk: “Refund requires original purchaser biometric.”  
He gestures to Mum, who is already marching toward escalator,stride matching the drums.

—— side-thought ——  
Your MacBook sleeve feels roomy; two inches of air between padding and aluminium. A MacBook Air on the display table winks at you, edge-lit, price tag curling like a beckoning finger.

—— available verbs ——  
(pursue-mum | steal-MBA | create-scene | text-coco | wake)

> inspect MBA-display  
Security camera rotates clockwise, then freezes—time smears, ½ speed.  
You lift the demo unit: weight identical, serial just one digit off yours.  
A perfect palindrome swap; who could tell?

Inventory after hypothetical swap:  
- MacBook Air (yours)  
- MacBook Air (store, concealable)  
- sleeve (room for one)

—— conscience daemon pop-up ——  
“Integrity checksum: 86 %”  
Buttons: [Justify] [Repent] [Defer]

> defer  
You tuck the thought under the receipt in your pocket.  
Drums crescendo—band turns into bedding, rows of white comforters like surrender flags.

> pursue-mum  
You weave through formation; shoppers pivot, bayonet coat-hangers.  
At the top of the escalator you catch her sleeve.

npc> Mum: “Returns are for people with regrets. Do you look like someone with regrets?”  
She taps your forehead with the platinum card—cold enough to leave a chip-shaped mark.

system: loyalty stub glows—upgrade available: “Voice of Reason (1-time)”  
Use? y/N

> y  
Your next sentence arrives pre-authenticated:  
“Store credit keeps the gift alive—lets her pick what she’ll actually play. Otherwise the console stays shrink-wrapped, a monument.”

Mum freezes; for a frame she’s a mannequin, then reboots.  
npc> Mum: “Fine. 90 seconds. I’ll wait by the perfume trench.”  
Timer blooms: ⌛ 1:30

—— sprint back ——  
Coco already at returns, clutching PS1 like a puppy.  
You hand her the receipt, whisper the plan.  
Clerk scans; register spits out credit chit—sky-blue, holographic dove.

npc> Coco: (soft) “You always rescue the moment.”  
She pockets the chit, kisses your cheek—static shock jumps, tastes like ozone.

—— band exits ——  
Drums dissolve into elevator muzak.  
Mum glides away, perfume vapor forming parentheses around her silhouette.

—— epilogue menu ——  
1. Exit store into parking-lot twilight.  
2. Slip back to MacBook table, finish earlier impulse.  
3. Follow Coco to gaming aisle, co-op dream.  
4. ^C^C (wake)

Kimi K2 1 has ended the conversation with ^C^C.
