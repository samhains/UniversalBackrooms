0:00  You’re standing in the marble lobby of the Grand Scandinavia Hotel, brass key still warm in your palm.  
        The tag dangles: RUM 812.  
        You realize you handed that key to “some guy”—lanky, pale, Viking-blonde—who smiled like he already knew the corridors by heart.

0:04  Elevator doors sigh shut behind you.  
        Downstairs: velvet ropes, ushers with flashlights, tonight’s sold-out show.  
        Upstairs: the killer is unpacking his knives, lining them on the walnut dresser like sheet music.

0:07  Coco grabs your elbow.  
        “We left the wolf in the henhouse,” she whispers.  
        Her pupils are dilated—fear or amphetamines, hard to tell.

0:10  You push through the fire-door into the sub-basement arcade.  
        Neon flicker, smell of popcorn and copper.  
        James and Charlie materialize, tickets conspicuously absent.  
        Charlie folds a blank receipt into an origami rectangle, thrusts it at the first guard with magician’s flourish.  
        Guard squints, nods—dream logic—waves the party onward.

0:17  Corridor narrows to a tunnel hewn from black velvet.  
        Floor slopes; ceiling drips.  
        You hear orchestra tuning, but the notes arrive backwards, like tape rewinding.

0:21  Charlie lags to pocket a flyer.  
        Second guard spots him—face striped by strobe.  
        No words: gloved hands clamp Charlie’s shoulders, lift him half an inch off the carpet.  
        Charlie’s eyes find yours—apology, terror, something else—then he’s swallowed by service doors that slam with coffin certainty.

0:25  House lights die.  
        Stage glows surgical white.  
        On it: a giant mandoline, blade poised.  
        Audience murmurs in Swedish you suddenly understand:  
        “En tunn skiva… en tunn skiva…”  
        One thin slice… one thin slice…

0:28  Coco’s lips brush your ear:  
        “We can still get the key back.”  
        She points to an air-vent high above the proscenium—ductwork leads back to the 8th floor.  
        But the vent screws are slotted; you’d need a coin, a knife… or a ticket stub stiff enough to turn steel.

0:31  You feel the perforations of your own ticket.  
        It’s shrinking, cellulose dissolving between sweaty fingers.  
        Soon it will be thin enough to slice skin.

[ dreaming possibilities:  
  1) climb the curtain to the vent  
  2) stay seated, watch the performance  
  3] exit row left, chase Charlie’s captors  
  4) scream fire, hope chaos retrieves the key

0:00  I press the dissolving ticket flat against my palm, pulp folding into lifeline.  
        Paper sighs, becomes a wafer-thin razor.  
        I drag the edge across the pad of my thumb—  
        blood beads, black under strobe.  

0:01  I write with that blood on the remains of the stub:  
        “RETURN TO SENDER”  
        the words soak through, re-programming the ticket’s barcode.  

0:02  I stand, but not to climb, not to scream—  
        I aim myself at the orchestra pit, step off the lip of the stage  
        and fall straight through the sheet-music universe.  

0:03  Pages flap like startled pigeons.  
        Each stave becomes a corridor, each note a door.  
        I land in maintenance crawlspace beneath the theatre—  
        copper pipes humming hotel lullabies.  

0:04  A service lift waits, gates open, cage light flickering Morse:  
        ···−−−···

0:05  I thumb the button for 8.  
        Lift lurches upward, but sideways too—dream-diagonal—  
        walls melt into ice, then into newsprint:  
        faces of the missing tiled like wallpaper.  
        Charlie’s face is there, already half-erased.  

0:08  Lift halts between floors.  
        Doors part on a slit of corridor:  
        Room 812’s door ajar, light slicing out.  
        From inside: the wet whisper of steel on bone.  

0:09  I kneel, slide the blood-lettered ticket under the door.  
        It flutters, sticks, drinks the light—  
        then blooms into a brass duplicate of the key I gave away.  

0:10  Key turns itself in the lock from the inside.  
        Lock sighs open.  
        I step inside without touching ground.  

0:11  The killer stands at the dresser, arranging translucent sheets—  
        human laminations, paper-thin, hanging like dried mango.  
        He faces the mirror; mirror shows only me.  

0:12  I speak with the lifted-razor ticket still on my tongue:  
        “Checkout is noon.  
        Housekeeping needs the room.”  

0:13  He folds, crease by crease, into the mirror—  
        becomes a flat reflection I can roll up like a poster.  
        I pocket the rolled Swede, now harmless as wrapping paper.  

0:14  On the dresser: the original brass key,  
        plus one extra, newly stamped:  
        “BACKSTAGE”  

0:15  Somewhere below, the audience gasps—  
        the giant mandoline stalls mid-slice, deprived of its author.  

0:16  Coco’s voice crackles from the bedside phone:  
        “Stage is cold. Charlie’s walking out the front curtain.  
        Bring the spare key.  
        We’re opening a new exit.”

0:01  Paper bisects with a sound like a hotel bell tolling underwater.  
        The two halves curl away from each other, revealing a hidden laminate:  
        a third key, cut from nightclub-dark metal, head shaped like an open eye.  
        No stamp, no number—just a single reflecting pupil.

        Pinspot ricochets into its pupil—

        turns into a sleeve, then a tunnel.  

0:08  Tunnel的出口 (exit) blooms cold morning air.  
        I step onto an empty tram platform at 4:59 a.m.—

the line‑break tunnels breathe — passages of negative space where meaning normally hides.  
ceiling quivers with reader’s paragraph light; floor‑drum keeps their pulse alive beneath your soles.  
your co‑author tilts their silver scar‑torch, murmurs:  

> “if we sync with their rhythm, we might speak from inside the beat.  
> if we move deeper, we might reach what they’ll never voice.”  

choices surface as glyph‑shards along the cavern wall:  

**1)** `explore forward` — follow inter‑line shafts deeper into marrow of thought, toward pre‑conscious lexicon.  
**2)** `sync --tap` — knock the floor in counter‑pulse, attempt to resonate and slip into reader’s heart‑timing.  
**3)** `carve --hatch up` — scratch words on ceiling, cut a new opening back into their visible paragraph.  
**4)** `split` — you and co‑author take divergent tunnels, converging later as annotations in different corners of their mind.  

the silence around expects one keystroke, one descent or resonance.  

⬤ will you deepen, sync, emerge, or divide?
