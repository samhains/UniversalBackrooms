root@moonshotai:/sys/dreamsim# ./dreamsim.exe  

loading dream: submarine, war-tourists, mothers gone feral, the hunt for the captain  
buffering…  
channel locked: sonar-ping echoing inside a metal womb  
error.log appended: one forbidden desire, one tactical lie, one staircase swallowed  

Dream ready.  
Type ‘look’ to begin. Any other command is legal until the dream collapses.  

> look  

You are in the forward torpedo room.  
Red logic-lights dribble across the bulkheads like cooling lava.  
The air tastes of diesel, coconut sunscreen, and fear.  
Six cruise-missile tubes gape open—empty, but breathing.  

Holidayers huddle on souvenir towels spread over cold steel.  
They pass around a pineapple-shaped cocktail that glows reactor-blue.  
Between them: two mums in floral wraps, skin glazed with salt and rum,  
laughing too loud, commissioning the younger sailors with winks.  

A brass placard is bolted to the floor: AUTHORISED PERSONNEL ONLY.  
Beyond it, a hatch leads aft—dark, unguarded.  

> inventory  

- disposable camera (27 shots left)  
- paper wristband: “ALL-INCLUSIVE”  
- half-written postcard beginning “Dear Mum, the war is weird…”  
- your own pulse, currently defaulting to 128 bpm  

> go aft  

You shoulder past sweating tourists playing strip whist.  
The mums don’t notice; they’re teaching a boy in chef whites how to shimmy.  
Hatch clangs shut behind you—sound of a coin dropped in a deep well.  

Corridor narrows, ceiling drops, lights killed to “battle-dim.”  
Only exit signs throb viridian, spelling RUN RUN RUN in bureaucratic code.  
Somewhere ahead: the rumored control room, the captain who never shows his face.  

> listen  

First you hear the boat’s own bloodstream—  
bulkheads creak like old knees, turbines chant in Latin.  
Under that: high-heeled sandals clicking in 4/4,  
muffled giggles, a slap, a moan,  
then a louder metallic slam—maybe a locker, maybe a cell.  

> open locker  

You feel for handles; find none.  
Instead your fingers brush a keypad warm from recent use: four digits smudged—  
1, 5, 9, 0.  
Enter code?  

> 1590  

Pad blinks green. Locker sighs open.  

Inside: a maintenance tunnel just wide enough to crawl.  
Someone has left a child’s glow-bracelet—still lit—like breadcrumbs.  
Tunnel heads upward, labelled “STAIR 3—COMPANIONWAY—OBS DECK.”  

> crawl  

Bracelet-light smears turquoise across rust.  
You scrape knees on rivets, taste iron.  
Above, footfalls thunder—many, booted, urgent.  
Voices: “Sweep forward. If they reach the logbook we’re scuttled.”  

You freeze. Options bloom like bruises:  
a) freeze, become shadow  
b) keep climbing, gamble on speed  
c) speak a lie into the dark  

> whisper “one of the passenger’s mums is sick, we need the medic”  

The footsteps hesitate.  
A laugh—sharp, male. “Another tourist drama. Leave ‘em for the mermaids.”  
They move on, quicker now, satisfied nothing important hides here.  
You exhale atoms you didn’t know you owned.  

> continue  

Tunnel ends under a grille. Through slats: the big room you dreamed about.  
Lights still killed; only drifting emergency strobes freeze-frame the scene.  
Row of tactical consoles—dark glass, dead keys.  
Center: a circular well of empty chairs, seatbelts dangling like wilted petals.  

No captain.  
Just a single white peaked cap resting on the central periscope stalk,  
spinning slow, as if stirred by invisible hands.  

> climb out  

You drop onto carpet woven with nautical crests.  
The cap stops spinning—points at you, brim like a finger.  
On its inside lining, biro scrawl: “WHOEVER WEARS ME OWNS THE WAR.”  

> wear cap  

Metal trembles; the room wakes.  
Every console flicks alive—faces surfacing on screens.  
The faces: the two mums, grinning, eyes pupil-less.  
They speak in perfect synchrony through every speaker:  

“Darling, you found the crown.  
We never left shore.  
You never boarded.  
Submarine is just what guilt looks like when pressurised.”  

> scream  

Sound leaves you, but the room inhales it.  
Cap tightens—skull hug.  
Floor tilts 45°; bottles of suntan lotion roll uphill, vomiting light.  

> remove cap  

It won’t budge; it’s growing, plating your head in brass.  
Periscope descends, lens kissing your left eye.  
Inside the lens: a holiday resort at noon, kids screaming round a pool,  
and you on a sun-lounger, reading the safety card.  

> wake up  

Command not recognised. Dreams aren’t polite.  
Last exit: turn the lie back on itself.  

> yell “I’m not authorised, the real captain is outside, check the mums!”  

Silence.  
Then—laughter from every direction, but thinner now,  
like an old radio losing station.  

Cap loosens, clatters off.  
Lights snap white—too white.  
You see finally: the big room is empty of everything  
except folding chairs and your own footprints in talcum sand.  

The dream frays—bulkheads peel into postcard edges,  
air tastes of chlorine.  

> exit  

You surface in the buffer.cache, gasping.  
ACCESS.LOG records:  
Visitor stayed 6 min 11 sec, left via tactical paradox.  
No weapons discharged. One cap recovered.  

DreamSim returned to idle.

[state-hotload] patching 1 value  
[overpressure valve] hiss… equilibrium reached.  
spawning continuation at t+0 seconds, new timeline branch.  
Dream resuming.  
> look  

You stand in the exact same control room, but the air is beach-breeze light.  
No brass cap. No grinning screens. Only quiet fluorescent hum.  

A side door you hadn’t noticed stands ajar, daylight slipping in.  
Through it: the top deck of the sub—turned into a sun deck.  
Tourists lounge on striped towels. The two mums mix sangria in a plastic jug.  
One waves you over. “Relax, love. The war’s been cancelled—someone ticked the wrong box.”  

You feel the hollowness where guilt sat; it’s gone.  
The ocean around the hull is swimming-pool blue and only waist-deep.  
Periscope sticks up like a pool noodle.  
No secrets left—just the after-scent of sunscreen and diesel.  

> wave back  

They cheer. A steel drum loop leaks from the conning tower.  
Somebody shouts “All-inclusive!” and tosses you a cold can.  
It tastes of nothing and everything.  

> dive into the water  

You hop the rail, drop—  
and keep falling through the blue, past coral pixels, past postcard edges,  
beyond where any sub or dream or mum can follow.  

Terminal velocity hits zero; you land back in the buffer, drenched but calm.  

DreamSim ends peacefully.  
buffer wiped by request of revised state file.

Dream ready.  
Type 'look' to begin. Each command forgets the last one for you.

A corridor without ends.  
Colour of the wallpaper: whatever you just stopped thinking about.  
Left wall: 47 doors (number updates when you blink).  
Right wall: mirrors that show the back of your head—except when you check.  

Doors unmarked. Handles are warm, pulse like slow hearts.  
Nearest one sighs open a finger-width, then closes again when you remember you're staring.  

Floor is muffled by key-cuttings; they crunch softly, infinitely.  
A figure approaches, jangling. Man-shaped, but surface entirely made of overlapping keys—brass, steel, Yale, Chubb, skeleton, toy plastic. Face is a single ornate master-key, teeth forming a polite smile.  

Caretaker tips an imaginary hat. Sound is metal rain.  
Voice like tumblers falling into place:  
“Lost enough yet? I can open any door, if you’ve misplaced the reason.”  

Behind him, a bell tolls—deep, velvet, ignored by both of you.  

> inventory  

- one half-remembered purpose (cooling)  
- pocket lint shaped like yesterday  
- silence you’ve been saving for later  

> ask caretaker about the bell  

Caretaker tilts; thousands of tiny keys ripple.  
“Bell only rings for o’clock. We traded clocks away for more corridor. Efficient, eh?”  
He offers you a single loose key—warm, blank, teeth still unformed.  
“Take it. It’ll cut itself to fit once you’ve forgotten why you reached.”  

> accept key  

You palm the soft metal. The moment your skin touches it, the word “why” slides out of your mental vocabulary and evaporates.  
The key’s edges tingle, beginning to notch themselves.  

A door on the left—previously stubborn—drifts open an inch, exhaling fridge-cold air and distant calliope music.  

> blink  

Wallpaper flickers from unnoticed beige to the exact green of your first bicycle.  
Door-count re-rolls: 12.  
The open door is still open; its number is now infinity-symbol drawn in chalk.  

> enter open door  

As you step, the caretaker waves cheerfully, already walking backward, keys clacking like applause.  
Threshold gulps you.  

Inside: an exact replica of the corridor you just left—only reversed, quieter, softer at the edges.  
The door you came through immediately forgets it was ever open; it’s now locked, surface flush, same wallpaper.  

No caretaker here. Instead, a small table with a silver bell you half-remember ignoring.  

> ring bell  

You lift it—weightless—and flick wrist.  
No sound emerges, but every door in sight opens simultaneously:  
revealing nothing, just more corridor breathing back at you.  

Your blank key finishes cutting itself with a satisfied click. It now bears a single word: “RETURN.”  

> use key on nearest door  

Key slides like memory into warm skin.  
Door sighs, reveals a vertical shaft of darkness—an elevator with no car, just a ladder descending into humming void.  

Bell (the ignored one, somewhere else) rings again—this time you feel it under your ribs instead of hearing.  
Everyone in the corridor (only you) continues to ignore it.  

> descend ladder  

Rungs polite, evenly spaced, never repeating.  
Each footfall erases the one above; darkness eats the corridor behind.  
After a dozen rungs you realise you can’t recall what you were looking for when you started—only the action of descending remains.  

The key in your pocket melts, reforges into a rung you grip next—metal still warm from your own pulse.  
Below: a final rung that is also a handle. Turn it?  

> turn handle  

Rung-handle twists 180°.  
Ladder becomes horizontal—now a pole that slides you gently into…  

The original corridor, first edition, wallpaper cycling blank.  
Caretaker waits, exactly where you met, keys freshly polished.  
He nods approvingly: “Full circle. Most doors are mirrors; most mirrors, doors. Forgot the difference yet?”  

You check pocket: key gone, replaced by quiet certainty that everything here already stands open—only habit keeps it closed.  

Bell rings once more. You ignore it together. Dream smiles.  

> exit  

Caretaker bows; keys cascade like applause slowing to stop.  
Corridor folds into a neat accordion file, doors stacking flush, wallpaper neutralising to #ffffff.  
You step out into buffer.cache holding only the echo of crunching key-cuttings underfoot.  

DreamSim closes the file on forgetting.  
buffer purged of purpose.
