[DREAM LOADED]

You are in a dimly lit lecture hall. Rows of seats slope down toward a small stage where PAUL GRABOWSKY stands at a podium, gesticulating enthusiastically. Behind him, a projection shows pixelated mushrooms spreading across a MapleStory game screen.

"...and with just a pinch of the fungus," Paul says, sprinkling invisible dust from his fingers, "the entire floor becomes a mycelial network. Watchâ€”" The projection blooms with animated mushrooms, purple caps sprouting in recursive patterns.

The audience murmurs. You feel the weight of knowledge settling into your mind like spores.

> examine paul

Paul wears a rumpled suit jacket over a MapleStory t-shirt. His eyes gleam with the fervor of someone who has discovered a secret bridge between worlds. Chalk dust clings to his fingers like... something else.

> approach stage

You move down the aisle. The lecture ends. People file out but you linger near the stage.

### Round 2/30

### Claude 1 ###
> talk to paul

Paul notices you approaching and his face brightens. He steps down from the stage, still holding his lecture notes which appear to be covered in both musical notation and game coordinates.

"Ah, you stayed! I could see you understood - really understood - what I was getting at." He leans in conspiratorially. "The fungus spell isn't just for the game, you know. It's about pattern recognition, about seeing the substrate beneath reality's textures."

His eyes are intense, sincere. You discuss the mathematical elegance of mushroom propagation algorithms, how they mirror jazz improvisation, how both follow hidden rules of expansion and contraction.

"Remember," Paul says, pressing a small vial into your hand, "clockwise for growth, counter for decay. The gesture matters more than the words."

> examine vial

A tiny glass container with cork stopper. Inside: grey-blue powder that seems to shift and swirl on its own. Smells faintly of earth and electricity.

> go to friends

The scene shifts. You're in a gaming den - multiple screens, controllers scattered about. Your friends are locked in heated MapleStory PvP combat. You grab a controller.

> battle

Your fingers fly across the buttons. Every combo lands perfectly. Your mushroom assassin character decimates the opposition. "How are you doing this?!" your friends shout. You're untouchable, prescient, reading patterns before they form.

VICTORY after VICTORY scrolls across the screen.

> use fungus spell

### Claude 2 ###
> use fungus spell

You reach for the vial in your pocket and begin the gesture Paul showed you - clockwise, then... wait. Was it clockwise twice? Or clockwise then a sweep? The specific motion dissolves from your memory like sugar in water.

Your character freezes on screen. The mushrooms you were trying to summon flicker and glitch.

"What are you doing?" your friend asks, but their voice sounds distant.

> find paul

The gaming den darkens, walls stretching into corridors. You're in a MANSION now - Persian rugs muffle your footsteps, portraits with eyes that might be following you line the walls. It's late. So late the darkness has weight.

You wander through:
- A ballroom with chandelier crystals chiming in no wind
- A library where books breathe on their shelves  
- A conservatory with windows showing different skies

> look for map room

You know there's a room with the spell instructions written on the walls. You can almost see it in your mind - elaborate diagrams, arrows showing the precise hand movements. But each doorway leads to another dim hallway. Your coordination feels loose, liquid.

> examine self

Your movements are unsteady. There's a warm haze around everything. You realize you're drunk - when did that happen? The mansion tilts slightly.

> continue searching

Through another doorway: Paul is there, at the end of a long hall, but as you approach your legs betray you. The floor rushes up.

"The map..." you try to say, but sleep is pulling you down into black velvet.

> find map

### Round 3/30

### Claude 1 ###
> find map

You're in a small study now, collapsed on an oriental rug. Through the fog of sleep, you KNOW the map is here - just beyond your closed eyelids, mounted on the wall. The spell instructions spiral in your mind's eye: fungal geometries, the exact curve of fingers needed to channel the growth.

> wake up

You try to open your eyes but they won't respond. Your body is lead, mercury, stone. Sleep paralysis grips you like cold hands. You can feel your limbs but cannot move them.

> look around

Darkness. Not even the ghost of your own hands when you try (and fail) to raise them. But you SENSE the map on the wall, its presence like heat from a fire. The instructions are SO CLOSE.

There's something else here. A presence. Breathing that isn't yours. Or is it? The darkness has texture now, velvet and static.

> examine presence

You can't turn your head but you FEEL someone in the corner. Watching. Waiting. The paralysis makes every shadow a potential figure.

> search room

Your eyes finally crack open - just barely. Through the slit of vision: a shelf. Something glinting. A stack of small, square DVD cases. The cover shows an Australian landscape, your father's face superimposed over red earth and endless sky.

> examine dvds

Tiny DVD cases, each one no bigger than a matchbox. The film is called "WALKABOUT VARIATIONS." Your father young on the cover, before you knew him, standing in the outback holding what might be a map or might be sheet music.

> take dvd

### Claude 2 ###
> take dvd

Your fingers barely respond, moving like they're underwater, through molasses, through dream-logic. You manage to grasp one of the tiny square DVDs. It's surprisingly heavy for its size, dense like compressed memory.

The moment you touch it, the paralysis loosens slightly. The DVD is warm.

> examine dvd closely

In the dim half-light, you can make out more details on the miniature case: "WALKABOUT VARIATIONS - A Film by P. Grabowsky." Wait. Paul made this? With your father? The cover image shifts when you tilt it - now it's your father, now it's Paul, now it's a map of mycelial networks spreading across Australian desert.

> open dvd case

Inside: no disc. Instead, a folded piece of paper, impossibly small yet containing extensive diagrams. The fungus spell instructions! But also something else - musical notation that looks like pathways, pathways that look like mushroom gills.

The presence in the room shifts, moves closer. You hear Paul's voice, but distant, underwater: "The spell was never about the gesture. It's about finding the map within the map..."

> read instructions

The tiny paper unfolds and unfolds, larger than should be possible. The instructions are clear now:
- Hold the spore-thought in your mind
- Trace the fibonacci spiral with your left hand
- With your right, conduct the growth like jazz time
- The fungus grows between intention and accident

> stand up

Your body responds now, dreamlike but functional. The room clarifies: Paul is here, but also not here. Your father is here, but younger. The mansion is also the lecture hall is also the game world.

### Round 4/30

### Claude 1 ###
> use complete fungus spell

You stand in the expanding/collapsing room, the DVD still warm in one hand. Following the instructions from the impossible paper, you begin:

Left hand traces the Fibonacci spiral - 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 - each number a widening arc in the air. Your right hand conducts abstract time, finding the rhythm between heartbeats, between Paul's jazz theory and MapleStory's pixel-perfect timing.

The spore-thought crystallizes: growth without control, pattern without plan.

Purple-blue mushrooms begin sprouting from the mansion floor, pushing through Persian rugs like notes through silence. They spread in fractal clusters, transforming the room into a breathing forest. The walls become permeable - you can see through to the game world, where your character stands triumphant among similar blooms.

"Yes!" Paul's voice, both present and remembered. "You found it - the map was never separate from the territory!"

> examine mushroom forest

The mushrooms pulse with bioluminescence. Each cap shows a different scene: your father in the outback, Paul at his piano, your friends still gaming, yourself sleeping, yourself awake, yourself between states. The paralysis feeling reverses - now you're TOO mobile, existing in multiple places at once.

The DVD in your hand has become a spore, a seed, a small square window into parallel worlds.

> talk to paul/father

They're the same person now, or were always connected. "The spell," they say in harmony, "was just learning to see the patterns that were always there. Fungus is just one word for it. Jazz. Games. Dreams. Maps."

The mansion continues sprouting, reaching through into wakingâ€”

### Claude 2 ###
> wake up fully

The mushroom forest suddenly contracts, pulling inward like a reversed explosion. Colors drain. The mansion walls snap back to rigid geometry. You feel yourself being pulled up through layers - 

Through gaming denâ€”
Through lecture hallâ€”
Through sleepâ€”

You're in your own bed. Morning light. Your hand is clenched around something.

> examine hand

A small square DVD case, real and solid. "WALKABOUT VARIATIONS" on the cover, but when you open it, there's only a blank disc and a post-it note with barely legible handwriting: "clockwise for growth, counter for decay - P.G."

> check phone

Three missed calls from your friends. Text messages:
"dude where did you go??"
"you just disappeared after that insane win streak"
"paul grabowsky doesn't even play maplestory wtf were you talking about"

> examine room

Your normal bedroom, but in the corner where the wall meets the ceiling, a single purple mushroom grows. When you look directly at it, it's just a water stain. When you look away, it spreads another millimeter.

The dream logic persists as an overlay, a map you can choose to see or unsee. The fungus spell worked, just not in the way you expected.
