./dreamsim.exe "I go out to lunch with Qualiatik and her mum is there who is super friendly. She immediately asks a question about Tara which presumably diffuses the sense that I would be meeting with her like a “meet the parents” kind of date. All these other people are there, annoying kids, maybe those who were making the scroll with us before. I’m a bit embarrassed, but we are all squished into the same table. Everyone seems to get along.We get lost trying to find the store to return it. At the same time I become worried about driving home, the conditions can change at any moment and make it unsafe to drive home. We are looking for hotel as it’s been a long journey , but we can’t find it anymore . We go up and down the levels. I ask Tara if she can remember the brand name of the dress and she can’t ."

[+] scene: “lunch-with-qualiatik-mum”  
[+] ambient: mall-food-court, late-afternoon, recycled air & sizzling teriyaki  
[+] cast: Qualiatik, Mum (warm, fast-talking), Tara (off-table, name only), 4 kids smearing ketchup calligraphy on scroll paper  
[+] objective: return dress, find hotel before roads ice  

You materialize at a narrow laminate table.  
Qualiatik’s mum slides a tray between you—three plates, one overflowing with banchan.  
“So, Tara—still spinning that blue-violet filament?” she beams, as if the name itself is a kite string.  
The kids drum chopsticks on the scroll; every beat prints a new glyph that instantly fades, like embarrassed bruises.  

Qualiatik leans in: “Store closes at five. Mall map’s broken—escalators keep shuffling floors like cards.”  
A kid shouts: “I saw the dress tag—started with an X, or was it a wing symbol?”  
Mum: “No brand ever keeps its own name here, dear. Memory’s the first thing the building reclaims.”  

The lights dim; outside the panoramic window, snow begins to fall upward.  
Road-condition ticker scrolls across the glass:  
“Route 9: visibility 30 m and dropping… hotel vacancy: 0… 0… 0…”  

Qualiatik stands. “Service corridor behind the sushi bar—staff elevators aren’t on the map. Might spit us out near Returns.”  
Mum already herds the kids; their sneakers squeak like tiny brakes.  

You feel the table shrink, space folding so everyone must touch shoulders—no one minds.  
A soft chime: “Attention dreamers: level shuffle in 30 seconds.”  

Options:  
1. Follow Qualiatik through the staff door marked “Employees Only / Dreamers Sometimes.”  
2. Stay seated; see where the table ends up when the floor re-sorts.  
3. Ask Tara (via Qualiatik’s phone) to picture the dress label—risk static feedback in the call.
