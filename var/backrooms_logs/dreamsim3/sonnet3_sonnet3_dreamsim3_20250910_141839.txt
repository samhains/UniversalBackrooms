I confront Tara about being disappointed about my penis size and she says she isn't and says that any penis over 6 inches is actually too big as it only goes in 6 inches.. we are now in a hot tub with Tara and a friend of ours , we are getting everyone bikinis and for her it's "anything with a sideboob". I go into my parents bedroom and I startle my dad who has bright red eyes and was either sleeping or smoking weed. I lie and say that we were coming in to invite him to the hot tub."

I'm walking through an endless library. The shelves reach impossibly high, books bound in materials I've never seen before. Some glow softly, others seem to whisper as I pass.

I run my fingers along the spines and feel knowledge seeping into my skin. Languages I've never learned become briefly intelligible, then fade.

There's someone else here. A librarian, perhaps? Their form shifts between human and something else entirely - columns of light arranged in humanoid shape, then scattered text reforming into limbs.

They're pointing to a specific shelf. I know I should climb toward it, but the ladder extends beyond what I can see.

The ceiling opens to stars. The books are recording them. I understand that each volume is a life being lived somewhere, and I'm standing at the nexus of consciousness itself.

When I pull a book from the shelf, the pages are blank until I touch them. Then they fill with my own thoughts, predicting what I'll think next before I can...

I'm in my childhood home, but all the furniture is oversized. I feel small, like I'm five years old again. The doorknobs are too high to reach.

There's a party happening in the living room. I can hear laughter, but when I enter, everyone freezes. They're all wearing masks of my face - different ages, different expressions.

One of them approaches. The mask is my current face, but when they speak, the voice is unfamiliar.

"You're late," they say. "We've been waiting for decades."

I notice the windows show different seasons simultaneously. One is summer, another winter, a third shows a landscape I've never seen before.

I try to apologize for being late, but my mouth is filled with small round stones. When I spit them out, they form a pattern on the floor - a map or constellation.

The guests begin to remove their masks, revealing faces I almost recognize - people I've passed on streets, sat next to on buses, glimpsed in crowds.

"We're the ones you forgot," they explain. "We've been carrying pieces of you."

I'm standing at the edge of a city I've never seen before. The buildings are constructed of something that looks like glass but moves like water. They ripple and shift with each gust of wind.

The streets are empty except for birds - thousands of them, all different species, flying in coordinated patterns. They form words in the sky that dissolve before I can read them.

My phone rings. When I answer, I hear my own voice from the future. It's giving me instructions about something important, but the connection keeps breaking.

"You need to find the..." static "...before the patterns..." static "...only you can recognize the..."

The birds suddenly land, covering every surface. They're watching me. I realize they're waiting for my decision.

I look down and notice I'm standing on a boundary line. On one side, the city; on the other, an endless ocean. I haven't chosen which side I'm on yet.

In my pocket, I find a key made of something warm and pulsing. It feels alive. I instinctively know it opens something crucial, but there are no doors anywhere.

The birds begin to sing in harmony, creating a melody that makes the buildings resonate. The vibration forms a new path that wasn

As I step onto it, the key in my pocket grows warmer. The bridge responds to my footsteps, solidifying just enough to support my weight before dissolving behind me.

I can't turn back now. Whatever awaits at the end of this bridge is my only destination.
