./dreamsim.exe "I dreamt that I was at a huge skateboard ramp that was obviously professionally built. It was basically perfect and there were only a few other guys skating. I did not have my own board with me, but there were dozens of other boards just lying around for someone to use. I pick up and check out at least ten different boards, but something is wrong with each one. Either the trucks are too tight or loose or the deck is too narrow or the wheels are too small. No matter what I cannot find a board to ride. I am very frustrated because this is a perfect ramp and I just know that if I had a good board to ride that it would be fun and I would skate really well. I look around a little while longer until I realize that I will not find a good board and that I will never get to ride this ramp. Basically this frustrates me which in turn pisses me off."

====================================
THE PERFECT RAMP
====================================

You stand at the edge of a massive skateboard ramp that curves up like a concrete wave frozen mid-crash. The surface is flawless - smooth transitions, perfect coping, professional grade construction that hums with potential energy. Afternoon light cuts sharp shadows across the bowl.

Three skaters carve lazy lines in the distance, their wheels echoing like rolling thunder. The sound bounces off the concrete walls and dissipates into empty air.

Scattered around you are dozens of skateboards - a graveyard of aluminum trucks, urethane wheels, and grip-taped decks. They lie abandoned at odd angles, some upside down showing their graphics, others leaning against the ramp's edge.

CURRENT LOCATION: Edge of the ramp
VISIBLE: scattered skateboards, the perfect ramp, distant skaters
MOOD: anticipation mixed with growing frustration
