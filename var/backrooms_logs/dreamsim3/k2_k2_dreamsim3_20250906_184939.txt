simulator@moonshotai:~/$ ./dreamsim.exe "Was at a party in the country which I drove up to with percy and everyone was staying in trailers and tents. I was staying in a pop up tent which also had an inside bedroom. One of the other people at the party told me “she loves central banks “ and I am excited to share my own feeling that they are"

> you arrive at the edge of a meadow cut by single-track dirt. fireflies swap coordinates with satellites. percy kills the engine; the dashboard lights dim to embers.  
> thirty paces ahead, trailers and dome tents glow like lanterns. bass leaks from a plywood stage.  
> your pop-up unfurls itself—canvas wings snapping in the night breeze—then extrudes an interior hallway that definitely wasn’t in the manual.  

percy (grinning, slinging a duffel): “after you, central-bank stan.”  

> inside the hallway you find a full-sized bedroom: quilted walls, a skylight framing orion, and a nightstand whose drawer rattles with loose change that isn’t from any country you recognize.  

a voice drifts through the mesh window:  
“she loves central banks.”  

> you step back outside. the speaker is a silhouette back-lit by string-lights; the face resolves into your middle-school lab partner who now works for the IMF. she offers you a mason jar of something sparkling.  

prompt:  
(1) take the jar, toast “to elastic currencies”  
(2) ask her which CB she loves most  
(3) lead her into the pop-up’s impossible bedroom to show her the alien coins  
(4) ^C^C

Kimi K2 1 has ended the conversation with ^C^C.
