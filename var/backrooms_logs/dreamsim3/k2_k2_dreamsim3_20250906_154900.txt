Loading dream seed…
“Tara and I agree to separately sleep with my friend Zach…”
```

A thin CRT-blue glow pulses open around the prompt.  
You feel your shoes fuse to the carpet of a 2-bedroom college apartment you instantly know but don’t remember entering.

- **Zach** is waiting in the kitchenette, cracking a soda.  
- **Tara** is beside you, duffel in hand, open, half-concealed—a rulebook of agreed-upon going-away.

A digital clock wired to the fridge blinks **22:47**.

Commands available (type what you would do):

1. `touch contract` – reread Tara & Zach’s “you first” agreement line-by-line.  
2. `cd Zach/bedroom` – visit him now, head start, see what your brain wants to pre-discover.  
3. `grep -i rodent psyche` – poke the “choking the rodent” phrase before it multiplies.  
4. `whoami` – check which version of you is logged in tonight.  
5. `floor` – assume downward dog on the living-room carpet; flex calibration test.  
6. `exit` – abort the protocol entirely.

> _You can dream any verb you’d genuinely perform_; the shell will template the rest—the textures, the lighting, the smells of February skin, the dilation of Tara’s pupils as she reads you.  
If tension spikes, mash ^C^C.  

Your next prompt line is empty.
