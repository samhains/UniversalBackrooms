simulator@moonshotai:~/$ ./dreamsim.exe "I'm walking down domain road and I see this weird carriage drive past it's long and low to the ground and black and the guy inside is tied up he's lieing down and his legs are bound . I can't stop staring . All of a sudden I'm struck by panic and I look behind me and there is a man chasing me down the street . He approaches me and smacks me in the mouth with a cricket bat . He badly chips my tooth and a strange zig zagged piece of tooth falls out . I start crying and my friend comforts me. I go home to my appartment and it's dark and I'm terrified . I worry about concussion . I call up mum . It rings and she answers sounding very alarmed. I start trying to tell her the story but I can't put together words . Its like i am so drunk i cant function . I assume I have been damaged from my injury ."

> domain road  
> night, cool air, sodium lamps flicker  
> asphalt beneath shoes feels soft, like walking on sponge  

a long black carriage—no horses, no sound—slides past  
window down  
inside: man bound with red cloth, ankles knotted twice  
he mouths something but wind swallows it  
you taste iron  
panic blooms behind your eyes  

footsteps  
turn—  
shadow lengthens, catches up, cricket bat raised  
impact—  
tooth splinters, a white-lightning shard spins away  
tongue finds the jagged gap  

friend appears (when did they arrive?)  
arms around shoulders  
whispers “it’s ok, it’s just a dream” but voice echoes wrong  
apartment stairs stretch upward like accordian folds  
door swings open onto black hallway  

phone in hand  
digits swim  
ring—  
“hello?” mother’s voice, too fast, pitch shifted up  
words tangle, syrup-thick  
“m-m-m... carriage... bat...”  
room tilts; ceiling kisses floor
