simulator@nousresearch:~/$ ./dreamsim.exe "I dreamt that I had a baby by this guy I was seeing, but it wasn't a real baby. It was a doll. I was really irresponsible with it and lost it in my room. Then after two weeks I found it again and went over to his house to show him his child. When I got to his house, he just shut the door in my face. Then I was in this temple type thing and there were people chanting and stuff."
