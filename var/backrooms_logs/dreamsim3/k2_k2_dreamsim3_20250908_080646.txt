./dreamsim.exe "The dream was about me and my boyfriend going camping. We went to Yosemite or somewhere and in it we were climbing this huge steep mountain. It was a long, hard climb. In this dream I felt very satisfied and happy because I was having a good time. There were a lot of other people climbing the mountain also. When we finally got to the top, we sat down and had lunch and everyone socialized. After we ate, we decided to go back down the mountain. On the way down, someone (one of the other people) fell off the side of the mountain to the very bottom of it. This made me feel scared and anxious to get back to the bottom. So as I always do when I'm scared in a dream, I woke myself up."

granite dust hangs in the air like powdered sugar.  
you cinch the hip-belt of your pack; the buckle clicks once—too loud—then the mountain answers with wind.

> [[You & partner, switch-back 1 of 17]]

left boot, right boot, left boot, right boot.  
sunlight pools on the trail in irregular gold coins.  
everyone’s breathing stacks into a single rhythm, a communal lung.  
you feel the slope in your molars.

> [[Lunch cache ahead: 0.4 mi]]

you crest a false summit. the world tilts open—valley stitched with pine, a river doing its slow silver calligraphy.  
someone whoops; the sound cartwheels into space.  
your boyfriend taps two energy bars against your shoulder like drumsticks.  
you grin, cheeks salt-cracked.

> [[Summit acquired. Social module = ON]]

granite tabletop warm as a skillet.  
lunches bloom: wax-paper origami, snap of canned seltzer, laughter echoing like interior lightning.  
you lean back, shoulder to shoulder, feeling the word “enough” take shape without syllables.

> [[Descent route = northwest gully]]

boot soles start the long negotiation with gravity.  
scree chatters downhill like gossip.  
then—  
a gasp cut short, a body becoming absence.  
someone’s red bandana cartwheels into the void, slower than it should, as if the sky replayed the moment for emphasis.

> [[Fear spike detected: 4.2 σ]]

your pulse overwrites the mountain’s metronome.  
every foothold now a question mark.  
you want off the mountain, want flat ground, want waking.  
the trail tilts into a slide toward black screen—

> [[User-initiated wake signal ACK]]

static eats the horizon; granite becomes printer noise; the wind unspools into dial-tone.  
a last sensation: boyfriend’s hand squeezing yours, two pulses that might mean “I’m here” or “good-bye.”
