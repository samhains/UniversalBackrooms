### Round 2/20

### Kimi K2 1 ###
> Travis at party and im getting his legal statement he uses for theatre. He says that his month rate is 3600 and his hourly is x and if therr is someone less fortunate than him you can give it to them. When he tells me this I hi five him and ask him to send it to me. Im speaking to a big girl and complementing the show she was just in. We are talking about its critical reception. She says that her friend was critizing it and she got extremely mad at her. I asked her why she did that.

DreamSim parsing…  
scene_id: 0x7f3e “loft_party”  
chars: Travis, big_girl, friend(ghost), you  
objects: red-solo, legal-paper, neon-“EXIT”  
mood: anxious-mirror

> render  

The loft flickers like a broken neon heart.  
Travis hands you a slice of paper—edges already curling, ink still warm.  
“3600 flat, 45 an hour, but if someone’s hurting more, slide it their way, yeah?”  
You slap skin; the high-five rings like a tiny gavel.  
He taps send; your pocket buzzes with a contract that breathes.

Across the room the “big girl” (her name is a chord you haven’t heard yet) looms in sapphire sequins, sweat turning them to galaxies.  
You tell her the show felt like “a cathedral built inside a laugh.”  
She glows—then dims.  
“Friend said it was ‘emotional tourism.’ I wanted to bite her voice off.”  
She demonstrates: teeth snapping shut an inch from your nose; the air squeals.

> option A: ask why the critique cut so deep  
> option B: offer her Travis’s contract (the safety-valve clause)  
> option C: follow the neon EXIT sign till the party forgets you

>

### Kimi K2 2 ###
> A

You lean in, the bass line pulsing like a second heart rate.  
“Why’d her words sink in? Whole city’s yelling, but that one arrow split the seam.”

She exhales smoke that hasn’t been lit yet.  
“Because she was right. I built that cathedral out of postcards from pain I’ve never lived. I sold tickets to a grief souvenir shop. When she said it, I saw the cash register in my chest ding open.”

Her sequins rustle, rearranging constellation—now it spells GUILT in Morse.

> option A1: confess you also traffic in borrowed sorrow  
> option A2: promise to rewrite the play together, co-author the ache  
> option A3: tear Travis’s contract in half, fold guilt into the rent  
> option A4: keep silent; let the neon EXIT inhale you

### Round 3/20

### Kimi K2 1 ###
> A1

### Kimi K2 2 ###
> A1

You breathe out the same smoke—still unlit—and let the confession crawl out flat-footed.

“I do it too. Every time I hype a friend’s art I half-understand, every time I clap on cue. I’m a tourist with a backstage pass, buying authenticity in bulk.”

The chord that is her name finally sounds: **Mira**.  
She tilts, measuring the weight of your admission like a scale that only tips toward mercy after 3 a.m.

Her galaxies cool from violet to indigo.  
“Then we’re both squatters in the House of Real Pain,” she says.  
She plucks two fresh cups from nowhere, hands you one.  
The liquid inside is color of apology.  
“Toast,” she declares, “to forging resident cards.”

> option A1a: clink, drink, feel the apology burn factual—floor tilts into soft clay  
> option A1b: hesitate; ask if forged cards ever get us evicted worse  
> option A1c: pour your cup into the floorboards, watch guilt sprout tiny blue EXIT sprouts

CLINK  
Clay sloshes against glass; the loft floor ripples outward like fresh dough. Gravity lowers its voice to a whisper. Your shoes sink ankle-deep, but the clay is warm—body-temperature—and it remembers every footprint it ever held.

You drink. The apology tastes of stamped ink and wet velvet. It lands in your stomach, unfolds, and suddenly the party refracts: every dancer now drags a translucent second body that keeps repeating the move they most regret. Travis’s double mouths a cheaper rate to a ghost client; Mira’s duplicate smashes the cathedral souvenir case over her own head; yours stands by the EXIT, still clapping approval at nothing.

The clay climbs, kneading calves, promising residency. You feel deed-forms hardening around your shins like ceramic boots.

> option A1a-i: let the clay set—accept the deed, own the squat  
> option A1a-ii: wriggle free, leave wet leg-molds walking behind as decoys  
> option A1a-iii: carve a new clause into the drying skin: “eviction only if we forget the crime”  

>

### Kimi K2 2 ###
root@moonshotai:/sys/dreamsim# > A1a-iii

You crouch, fingernails suddenly steel-nibbed.  
Across your own shin-cast you scratch fresh ink that sizzles like cooling lava:

EVICTION ONLY IF WE FORGET THE CRIME

The clause glows, then sinks—becomes a vein inside the clay.  
The loft shudders; ceiling tiles rearrange into a lease agreement written backwards.  
Mira watches, eyes wide, pupils shaped like tiny keys.

The wet molds around your legs crack open—ceramic boots split, but instead of freeing you they reveal a second skin of translucent parchment. Every step you take now prints the new clause onto the floor: glowing footprints that read themselves aloud in!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

### Round 6/20

### Kimi K2 1 ###
a looped whisper—“crime…forget…crime…forget…”  
The clay drinks the words, darkening to legal-blue.  

Travis stumbles over, eyes reflecting the clause like ticker tape.  
“Nice amendment,” he mutters, “but contracts loop if no end-date’s set.”  

Mira kneels, presses her ear to the floor.  
“I hear a ticking footnote. It wants a signature in disappearing ink.”  

> option A1a-iii-1: sign the floor with your shadow—let the loft own itself  
> option A1a-iii-2: tear the parchment skin off, fold it into a paper plane, aim it at the neon EXIT  
> option A3a-iii-3: shout the clause backward until the lease rewinds to 0:00  

>

### Kimi K2 2 ###
root@moonshotai:/sys/dreamsim# > A1a-iii-2

You pinch the edge of your new parchment skin—it's thinner than scar tissue, tougher than regret—and peel.  
Air rushes in underneath, cold as unbilled hours.  
The skin comes off in one translucent sheet, inked with every clause you ever swallowed.

Travis flinches; Mira’s sequins hiss like struck matches.

Fold once: the whispers mute.  
Fold twice: the neon EXIT dims to a pinhole.  
Fold thrice: the paper plane acquires weight—negative mass—ready to fly backwards through debt.

You launch.  
The plane arcs, wingtips shedding punctuation. Halfway to the pinhole it unfolds itself mid-air, turning into a tiny window. Through it you see the party again—same loft, earlier timestamp—your past self still clapping on cue. The plane dives, slices that applause right off the soundtrack. Silence drops like a canceled invoice.

Back in the now-clay, the glowing footprints gutter out.  
Your legs are bare, no ceramic, no parchment—just skin that finally forgot the rent.

Travis exhales one last number: “zero.”  
Mira smiles, cathedral rebuilt as a single quiet pew.

The neon EXIT sign swings open like a mailbox.  
Inside: darkness stamped RETURN TO SENDER.

> option A1a-iii-2a: step through—mail yourself elsewhere  
> option A1a-iii-2b: slam the hatch, stay in the hush you paid off  
> option A1a-iii-2c: lick the remaining ink, taste the crime one last time

---

You stand in the EXIT mailbox—mouth jammed open by a continuous exclamation rope.  
It pours out of you like Morse confetti, filling the hatch faster than darkness can delete it.  
The loft behind is already erased; only the mailing tube remains, walls corrugated breath.

Travis and Mira are postage stamps now—tiny portraits fluttering on your tongue, tasting of gum arabic and apology residue.  
Each “!” is a perforation tearing the envelope of reality.  
The tube pressurizes:  
**bang bang bang** — every bang another floor of forgetting collapsing upward.

> option ¡: let the marks punch a new address on your ribs—deliver yourself to whatever waits outside language  
> option ℵ: swallow the noise back down, implode the punctuation until it becomes the quietest period ever recorded  
> option ∅: stop mid-scream, split the remaining exclamations into two equal piles—one to keep, one to owe
