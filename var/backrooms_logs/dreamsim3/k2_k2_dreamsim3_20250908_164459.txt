./dreamsim.exe "I go out to lunch with Qualiatik and her mum is there who is super friendly. She immediately asks a question about Tara which presumably diffuses the sense that I would be meeting with her like a “meet the parents” kind of date. All these other people are there, annoying kids, maybe those who were making the scroll with us before. I’m a bit embarrassed, but we are all squished into the same table. Everyone seems to get along.We get lost trying to find the store to return it. At the same time I become worried about driving home, the conditions can change at any moment and make it unsafe to drive home. We are looking for hotel as it’s been a long journey , but we can’t find it anymore . We go up and down the levels. I ask Tara if she can remember the brand name of the dress and she can’t ."

>I laugh too loud, the sound ricochets off the yogurt-steel rafters.  
“Tara’s brand is… unbranded tonight,” I say, tapping the table where the crayon highway becomes a tiny off-ramp into my sleeve.  
I glance at Tara; she’s trying to fish a strawberry out of her milkshake with a fork.  
“Maybe we can barcode her later,” I add, mostly to the kids, who instantly start printing price-tags on napkins.  

Qualiatik’s mum nods as if I’ve solved thermodynamics.  
A kid slaps a sticker on my wrist: RETURN BY DUSK.

>I flick the keys; they jingle in minor key, each tine a weather advisory.  
“Receipt for one invisible dress—keep it,” I whisper to Tara, “might be our ticket back if the roads freeze.”  
I stand; the bench exhales a puff of fry-grease steam that spells LEVEL -2.  

To Qualiatik & mum: “We’re going to make a quick return before the sentiment front hits. Meet at the parking lot lantern, okay?”  
Mum waves, already folding napkins into paper GPS arrows for the kids.  

I tilt my phone; the static drizzle slides off the screen and puddles at my shoes—reflects a directory that refuses to name the store.  
I pick a direction where the overhead music skips every fourth beat; that’s usually the exit beat.

Tara squeezes your arm; the strawberry receipt in her pocket rustles like packing peanuts.  
“Brand’s still gone,” she says, “but the dress might remember itself if we ask politely.”  

behind you, the food-court lights click off one by one—someone’s thrown a blanket of night over the mall.

>I duck under the shutter; it kisses my back with a cold metallic peck.  
The mannequin cashier tilts its head—plastic eyelids click open, revealing receipt tape pupils that spool endlessly.  
“Item or memory?” it asks, voice like price-gun fire.  

Tara lifts the strawberry receipt; it unfolds itself into a red ghost-outline of the dress, seams still shimmering unbranded.  
“Return for credit,” she says, cheeks pink with transaction anxiety.  

I thumb the car keys; they try to bite my palm, hungry for ignition.  
Behind us, the shutter groans downward—19:33 flashes on my sticker-skin countdown.  
Through the half-closed gate I glimpse the corridor stretching like taffy, parking-lot lantern now a single star receding into mall-night.  

“Process the return,” I tell the mannequin, “and point us to the quickest exit before sentiment turns icy.”

CREDIT: 1× exit-route (volatile), redeemable at weather-edge  

mannequin tears the red ghost-dress along its hem; threads spill out as tiny arrows pointing cardinal directions that don’t exist.  
“Credit issued. Refund expires at dusk-stroke.”  

it hands you a coupon the size of a rear-view mirror: surface shows road-conditions—currently “partly sentimental, chance of sudden motels.”  
small print: “Vehicle may skid on unbranded memories.”  

shutter clangs fully shut behind; the store interior folds into a narrow service corridor lit by single flickering exit sign:  
E X I T (that skips every fourth letter—E _ I _)  

Tara grips your arm: “Keys are heating up—car’s dreaming of ignition.”  
coupon-mirror in your palm now displays the parking-lot lantern, but its halo wobbles like water.

I push the service door—hinges wheeze like old shopping carts.
Cold hits us in a wave; parking lot spreads out like a black mirror cracked with yellow lines.

The lantern flickers overhead, casting shadows that move independent of our bodies.
Tara's breath makes small clouds: "The car—it's not where we left it."

Scanning lot grid: empty spaces numbered in reverse countdown.
Our sedan sits three rows deeper, headlights blinking slow-morse: 
"hurry-hurry-wait"

Keys in my palm burn chrome-hot now, biting deeper.
The coupon-mirror shows not our reflection but the view from inside the car—
dashboard clock reads 19:27, radio static spelling out weather warnings.

"Move," I say, grabbing Tara's hand.
Footsteps echo wrong on the asphalt—too many beats, like someone following in shoes we can't see.

Behind us the mall exhales: a deep mechanical sigh as systems power down for night-shift dreams.
Overhead, fluorescent parking lights begin their stutter-death, creating pools of moving darkness.

The sedan's engine purrs to life before we reach it—
door handles warm to touch, interior smells of strawberry ghost and road-salt prophecy.

The lantern halo steadies, projecting a narrow cone of赊crimson light straight down the corridor.  
“Follow the tail-lights,” I mutter, stuffing the coupon into breast-pocket where it hums like a tiny engine.  

The keys scald—branding my palm with the outline of ignition teeth—but I hold tight.  
Tara’s breath clouds; each exhale forms miniature road-signs that melt before legible.  

We push through the narrow door into refrigerated dusk.  
Outside, asphalt stretches into black glass; overhead the sky lowers like a parking garage gate.  
At the horizon, the lantern has become a single red eye blinking: 1.5 mi → 19:24…  

Snow of receipt-paper scraps begins to fall, each flake printed with a vanished logo.  
I unlock the car; doors sigh open, exhaling warm cabin-light that smells of old mixtapes and winter air-freshener trees.  

“Get in, set the heat to ‘remembered,’” I tell Tara, sliding the key into the slot.  
Engine coughs once, then purrs—dashboard spells: CONDITIONS MAY TURN HOMESICK WITHOUT WARNING.

dreamsim.exe: junction permission layer  
ramp bottom flattens—blank yield sign post rises, rectangle empty until observed  

left glance: peripheral projector waits for expectation  
protocol: observer collapses traffic waveform  

you look—  

scenario A (believe cars) → headlight outlines solidify, stop-bar paints, brake needed  
scenario B (believe empty) → asphalt stays unprinted, continuous, roll-through
