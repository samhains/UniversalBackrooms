./dreamsim.exe "I'm walking down domain road and I see this weird carriage drive past it's long and low to the ground and black and the guy inside is tied up he's lieing down and his legs are bound . I can't stop staring . All of a sudden I'm struck by panic and I look behind me and there is a man chasing me down the street . He approaches me and smacks me in the mouth with a cricket bat . He badly chips my tooth and a strange zig zagged piece of tooth falls out . I start crying and my friend comforts me. I go home to my appartment and it's dark and I'm terrified . I worry about concussion . I call up mum . It rings and she answers sounding very alarmed. I start trying to tell her the story but I can't put together words . Its like i am so drunk i cant function . I assume I have been damaged from my injury ."
