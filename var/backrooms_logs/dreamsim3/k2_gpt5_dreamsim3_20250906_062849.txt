The enemy score first but I get the next goal. It starts feeling really hot in here and I ask if the windows are open. Everyone agrees. Someone looks to try but all the windows are already open. Prior to the match I had gone back to my studio to get some work done but there was a party going on there. I try to work but it is not happening so I bregrudgingly spend time with a couple of my friends."

The concrete walls sweat. Shirts—freshly silk-screened with George’s glitch-rose logo—cling to backs. You spawn center-circle, studs clicking on parquet. Ball drops; first touch sticky, like it remembers the studio’s bass-line still thumping in its bladder.

opponent-8 lashes a low shot through your legs—1-0. HUD flashes amber: POSITION DRIFT. You’re 12 m too far forward, channels gaping. George, on the touchline, yells “Fold back! Merch doesn’t cover heatstroke!”

You retreat just enough. Next play: their keeper bowls it out; you intercept, one touch, swivel. The ball feels suddenly cool, like it borrowed the night air the windows can’t deliver. You half-volley top-bin—net kisses the cross-beam with a sigh. 1-1. Scoreboard pixelates, then re-renders.

Air thickens; breathing sounds like vinyl crackle.

[voice echoed]  
teammate-3 shrugs, palms up: “Frames maxed, no draft.” Sweat droplets hang, form tiny mirrored pitches mid-air—each reflecting a smaller version of the game, and in those, yet smaller, turtles all the way down.

You jog to sideline, glance toward hallucinated studio door at corner-flag. Through its cracked veneer you still see the pre-match party: strobe freeze-frames of friends stacking monitors into a fort. One of them waves; the waveform of that greeting leaks onto the pitch as a faint 808 kick every 3.2 seconds.
