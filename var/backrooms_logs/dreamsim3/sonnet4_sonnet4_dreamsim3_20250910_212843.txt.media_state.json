Central is Nisha\u2014sometimes a battered, crying child, sometimes only phantom warmth in empty arms. The pram rocks, blankets twist, presence collapses into absence. Strangers multiply with shifting faces, then resolve into every accusing voice the narrator has carried, especially a man with \u201ckind eyes\u201d who embodies condemnation and blame. Parents flicker between mourners and judges. As walls dissolve, grief anchors to the hospital: late-night corridors, machines, the impossible stillness of loss. Motifs echo\u2014phantom weight, searching for what is already gone, rage softening into guilt, dream protection giving way to harsh truth, and finally mercy: holding contradictions without resolution."}
