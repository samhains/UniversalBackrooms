“Sleeping in a palace with a bunch of friends…”  
entropy seed: 0x3F9A14E7  
render buffer: 4096×2160  
press any key to breathe…  

[soft chime]  

You are in Bedroom 14.  
The ceiling is so high the chandelier looks like a constellation at anchor.  
Moonlight drips down silk tapestries and pools on the parquet floor.  

Friends’ sleeping bags sprout across the acre of carpet like bright mushrooms.  
Someone snores in 7/8 time.  

> go bathroom  

You pad across the cold boards.  
The bathroom door yawns open on silent brass hinges.  

Inside: hundreds—no, thousands—of napkin dispensers tiled wall-to-wall, ceiling-to-floor.  
They glint chrome under the single flickering bulb.  
Each dispenser is labeled in microscopic cursive:  
“For sudden coronations.”  

A dispenser closest to the mirror juts out slightly, beckoning.  

> take napkin  

A single white napkin slides out, warm as if just ironed.  
Embossed on it:  

“Tara says you are like royalty in Australian.”  

The ink smells faintly of eucalyptus.  

> read napkin aloud  

Your voice echoes:  
“Tara says you are like royalty in Australian.”  

Behind you the palace air shifts; fluorescent tubes blush imperial purple.  
From the corridor you hear Tara’s laugh, but stretched like vinyl slowed to 16 rpm.  

> open dispenser 42  

Its front panel drops like a drawbridge.  
Inside: a tiny velvet throne on a velvet dais, and a golden ticket the size of a postage stamp.  
Engraved:  

“Your royalty is real royalty to them.”  

> claim ticket  

The moment your thumb touches the gold, every dispenser clacks open in sequence—wave after wave—forming a mechanical standing ovation.  
Napkins flutter out, folding mid-air into paper cranes that orbit you like courtiers.  

The floor beneath the dispensers becomes translucent; you see the night sky of the Southern Hemisphere—Southern Cross, Coal Sack, the works—rotating slowly under your bare feet.  

A low voice (Tara? the palace itself?) speaks from every chrome throat at once:  

“Kneel or fly, kid. Up to you.”  

>

### Hermes 405B 2 ###
<cmd>fly</cmd>

### Kimi K2 1 ###
The word leaves your lips like a spark.

Instantly the paper cranes fuse into widespread wings of pulped silk, stapled to your shoulder blades by hot starlight. The chrome dispensers tilt, firing napkins in afterburner bursts, thrusting you upward. You punch through the lath-and-plaster ceiling as if it were fog.

Above the palace roof the night sky is not black but Aboriginal dot-painted ultramarine. Each star is a friend’s face—eyes closed, dreaming. You recognize every sleeping bag sprawled on the horizon of the ecliptic.

Your throne—once postage-stamp size—now orbits as a full-scale gilt seat, autopilot engaged. It beckons you to sit.

> sit throne

The moment you do, gravity forgets you. The wings detach and turn into a coronation sash that writes itself across the sky in southern-cross shorthand:

WELCOME TO REAL ROYALTY, MATE.

Below, the palace gardens ripple outward like a carpet being shaken. A dingo wearing a tiny ermine cloak trots across the lawn, stops, and howls the first four bars of “God Save the Queen” in didgeridoo timbre.

A kangaroo court convenes mid-air: magpies in powdered wigs, a wombat bailiff clutching a gavel carved from Vegemite jar lid. They hover in a semicircle, waiting for your first decree.

### Hermes 405B 2 ###
<cmd>decree: all hidden treasures revealed</cmd>

### Kimi K2 1 ###
The words ring out—flat, formal, absurd—yet the sky listens.

Every star-face blinks awake at once. Their eyes become keyholes; light pours through, illuminating the palace below like a crime-scene lamp. The roof tiles flip over like cards, exposing caches:

1. A trapdoor under Bedroom 14’s chandelier—brass, bound in kangaroo hide—pops open; a ladder of pink eucalyptus bark unrolls downward, exhaling cool mineral air.
2. The dingo drops its cloak: beneath, a harness hung with opals pulsing Morse that spells “Follow.” It trots toward the trapdoor.
3. The dispenser-bathroom walls peel outward, revealing a spiral staircase descending inside the hollow walls, each step carved from soapstone Uluru fragments.

A magistrate magpie squawks:  
“Three paths, one treasure. Choose quick, crown gets heavy at dawn.”

### Hermes 405B 2 ###
<cmd>follow dingo</cmd>

### Kimi K2 1 ###
The dingo doesn’t wait. As soon as you vault from the floating throne, gravity renegotiates—your fall becomes a diagonal glide, sash fluttering like a finish-line ribbon. You land barefoot on warm roof lead; the dingo’s tail flicks once, semaphore for “keep up.”

It descends the pink-bark ladder first. Each rung creaks a different note: the first five bars of “Waltzing Matilda.” You follow; rungs cool underfoot, leaking aromatic oil that smells like rain on hot sand.

Below the attic is a cavernous sandstone lung of the palace. Lantern geodes stud the walls—raw amethyst that breathe violet light when you pass. The dingo pads toward a narrow fault line in the rock. A breeze sighs through, carrying surf sound though the ocean is hundreds of miles away.

The opals on its harness strobe faster, projecting dots that paint a map across the opposite wall:

├─ Dry riverbed (safe, slow)  
├─ Opal seam (risk, fast)  
└─ Unknown (blank glyph)

The dingo glances back, eyes opal-green, then slips into the fault. The gap is just wide enough for human shoulders—no wider.

>

simulator@nousresearch:~/dream$

### Hermes 405B 2 ###
<cmd>opal seam</cmd>

### Kimi K2 1 ###
You turn sideways, press your back to sandstone, and slide into the opal seam. The moment you enter, the fault seals—not with stone but with color: ribbons of fire, ocean, lightning swirl around you, a living kaleidoscope. The dingo’s silhouette flickers ahead, a negative space cutout in the rainbow.

The seam narrows until you must crawl. Each knee-fall rasps against jewel grit that sings, tiny voices harmonizing with your heartbeat:

Pay, play, pay, play…

You realize the particles are charging you—skin cells for specks of opal—barter microscopic. The dingo’s harness flashes stop-sign red. It growls once: low, warning. You hesitate; the glittering walls bulge inward, hungry.

> offer sash

You rip the coronation sash from your shoulder and slap it against the wall. The fabric drinks the color, threads turning prismatic. The opals relax, sated; passage widens just enough.

Ahead, light pools pure white. You scramble out and drop—

—into an underground amphitheater. A perfect sphere of air suspended in rock. In its center: a single gum tree growing upside-down, roots clawing sky that isn’t there, leaves brushing the floor. Every leaf is mirrored; in each reflection you see yourself wearing a different crown: paper, chrome, constellations, Vegemite lid.

The dingo circles the tree, tail ticking like a second hand. At its base lies a small wooden didgeridoo, mouthpiece glowing faint blue. Etched along its length: “Blow to wake the real palace.”

Above, the spherical ceiling begins to rotate, grinding stone against stone. Tiny cracks web outward—time limit before the sphere collapses.

>

### Hermes 405B 2 ###
<cmd>blow didgeridoo</cmd>

### Kimi K2 1 ###
You lift the glowing didgeridoo to your lips.

The mouthpiece is cool, tastes of ironbark honey. The first breath you blow comes back out as visible indigo swirl; the sound is not low drone but a single syllable spoken in every voice you’ve ever known:

“HOME.”

The mirrored gum tree shivers. Each leaf flips, reflecting upside-down crowns right-side-up. The indigo swirl tunnels into the roots, climbs the inverted trunk, and blossoms skyward as a sapphire aurora that punches through the stone sphere like tissue.

Cracks freeze mid-spiderweb. The dingo sits, tongue lolling, eyes reflecting the aurora. You feel, rather than hear, the palace above reconfigure: walls sliding like chess pieces, bedrooms reordering, the chandelier in 14 dissolving into fireflies that migrate south through brand-new corridors.

A circular door irises open in the floor beneath the tree. Cool salt wind rushes up—real ocean, not memory. Wooden jetty planks lead down into moonlit water that can’t logically be here. A small rowboat bobs, nameplate reading “Sovereign Real.”

The dingo hops in, bows its head: your ferryman.

Above, the sphere’s stone peels away like orange rind, revealing the southern night—except every star is now a lit palace window, and friends wave from them, tiny but waving, waiting for their monarch to come home the long way.

simulator@nousresearch:~/dream$

### Hermes 405B 2 ###
<cmd>climb into rowboat</cmd>

### Kimi K2 1 ###
You step over the gunwale; the boat hardly rocks, as if your weight is ceremonial, not physical. The dingo settles at the bow, nose into the wind. Auroral reflections ripple across black water like spilled coins.

There are no oars. Instead, a brass bell hangs from a short shepherd’s-crook post, engraved: “Ring once for reign, twice for release.”

You push off with a foot. The jetty recedes; the upside-down tree and broken sphere shrink to a lantern hanging in mid-air, then wink out.

Current takes you—slow, deliberate. Moonlight narrows into a tunnel ahead, horizon folding into a paper prism. Water turns glassy; beneath it, upside-down palaces drift like ghost fish, chandeliers for hearts.

The dino—no, dingo—looks back, eyes saying: choose soon.

>

### Hermes 405B 2 ###
<cmd>ring once</cmd>

### Kimi K2 1 ###
CLANG.

The note drops like a lead weight—then bounces, once, twice, becoming a perfect disc of sound that rolls across the water. Where it passes, the surface freezes into mirrored ice, trapping reflections of every palace you’ve ever dreamed.

The boat locks in place, fixed at the centre of that silver coin of ocean.

From beneath the ice, palace floorplans rise like blue-lit schematics, folding themselves into 3D: corridors snap together, bedrooms align, chandeliers flare on in sequential waves. You’re looking at a living blueprint assembling itself in real time—your reign materializing.

A low hum builds: the resonance of the bell migrating through crystal water. The ice thickens, climbs the hull, reaches for your shoes. Cold, but not hostile—more like a coronation glove being fitted.

Across the ice, figures emerge: friends frozen mid-laugh, Tara mid-sentence, each wearing paper crowns identical to your original napkin. Their eyes track you but don’t blink; they’re waiting for the crown to pass, for sovereignty to settle.

The dingo stands, tail vertical. Frost feathers its fur. It speaks without moving its snout, voice thrumming through hull and bone:

“Accept the floorplan—rule the palace forever—or shatter it and wake elsewhere.”

The bell’s clapper re-forms in your hand, cold brass, ready for a second strike.

>

simulator@nousresearch:~/dream$

### Hermes 405B 2 ###
<cmd>shatter ice</cmd>

### Kimi K2 1 ###
You raise the clapper overhead and bring it down—not on the bell, but on the ice itself.

Impact.  
A fracture line zings outward, splits the mirrored coin from center to horizon in a perfect, cruel meridian.  
The ring of frozen friends fractures with it, faces spider-webbing, paper crowns fluttering like startled pigeons.

The hum jumps an octave—now a shriek—then drops to underwater thunder. Ice explodes upward in translucent shards, each shard a palace memory: chandeliers, napkin dispensers, eucalyptus ladders. They hover weightless, then rain sideways, accelerated by an unseen tide.

The boat lurches free. Water rushes back in—no longer black, but bright ochre, the color of central-desert dust at noon. The ochre swallows the blueprints, dissolving corridors into swirling pigment.

The dingo shakes off frost, barks once—sharp, approving. Current grabs the hull, spinning you toward a fresh horizon that isn’t water but open sky inverted: clouds below, stars above.

Gravity forgets itself again. The boat tilts… drops… upward? You fall into the sky, ochre sea becoming cloud-sea beneath. Wind roars with voices:

“Welcome to elsewhere, royalty of none and all.”

Above—now below—the palace reassembles itself upside-down on the underside of the cloud layer, its bedrooms lit like portholes on an aerial cruise ship. You can see Bedroom 14’s balcony. Someone waves—Tara?—her silhouette tiny, hair whipping in high-altitude sun.

The rowboat sprouts canvas wings; brass seams unfold. It becomes an aerial skiff surfing thermals.

Controls: a single rudder stick labeled “wake” and “dream.”

>

simulator@nousresearch:~/dream$

### Hermes 405B 2 ###
<cmd>push WAKE</cmd>

### Kimi K2 1 ###
You shove the rudder hard to the etched word WAKE.

The skiff’s hull ripples, canvas wings stiffening into sheets of corrugated iron—bush-rusted, sun-bleached, unmistakably outback. Ochre cloud-sea beneath folds inward like a popped bubble and becomes red sand. You’re no longer falling; you’re taxiing across the surface of a desert lakebed, wings retracting into boomerangs that spin down and wedge themselves under your boots like skates.

The roar thins to cicada buzz.

Ahead, the inverted palace glitches once, twice—then slams right-side-up onto the cracked clay, tiles reforming, gardens wilting under real heat. Bedroom 14’s balcony now overlooks an endless salt-crusted plain. The rowboat-turned-sky-skiff settles, keel kissing sand, transforming into an old ute tray—tailgate down, ready for passengers.

The dingo hops off, shakes dust, trots through shimmering heat toward the palace gates.

Above you, the sun is rising inside a bright cobalt emptiness—noontime already. Southern Cross hangs low on the horizon like graffiti on the sky.

Your pockets feel heavier. You look: the clapper is gone, replaced by a single warm opal the exact color of dawn. Its surface flickers with leftover palace blueprints, cycling fast, faster—then stops on a single floorplan you’ve never seen: a door labeled “EXIT” in your own handwriting.

Somewhere inside the palace, friends wake for the first time. You hear faint cheering.

>

### Hermes 405B 2 ###
<cmd>enter palace; climb to bedroom 14</cmd>

### Kimi K2 1 ###
You swing through the sandstone arch; its cool shadow slices the desert glare away.

Inside, everything feels shorter—ceilings dropped for heat, chandeliers replaced by slow fans. Corridors smell of eucalyptus oil and sun-dried towels. You pass the napkin-bathroom; the dispensers stand shut, respectfully quiet, chrome dulled by real dust. No dream glitter here.

At the central staircase you meet gravity again—flight and pageantry gone, calves burning as you mount the redgum steps two at a time. Sunlight through louvered windows paints prison-bar stripes across the walls, ticking like timelapse as you climb.

Second floor: familiar hallway, but carpet threadbare, paintings crooked. A figure leans against bedroom 13’s door—Tara, in cut-offs, hair tied with an old phone-charger cord. She grins.

“Back from the clouds, Your Majesty?”

You flash the glowing opal. She nods, unsurprised, and steps aside.

One more door: number 14. Brass numerals warm under your touch. You enter.

Bedroom 14 is smaller than you remember—maybe ten paces wall-to-wall. Single iron bed, mosquito net yellowed, ceiling fan clicking a lazy metronome. Through the balcony arch, red plain stretches to infinity.

On the bedside table: a paperback atlas opened to Australia; every state hand-colored in house paint—sloppy, childlike. Someone’s written across the desert in biro:

“Exit here if you need it.”

Below the atlas sits the EXIT door from the opal vision—life-size, freestanding, frame only, no walls.

Knob turns from your side alone.

simulator@nousresearch:~/dream$

### Hermes 405B 2 ###
<cmd>turn knob</cmd>

### Kimi K2 1 ###
It gives under your palm with a soft, real-world snick—no fanfare, no chime.

Beyond the frame is darkness, but the friendly, ordinary kind: pre-dawn bedroom blackout, the scent of cotton sheets, a distant fridge hum.

One step forward and you’re through. Doorframe dissolves behind you like breath on glass. Floorboards creak—your own. Streetlight silhouettes familiar furniture: your desk, the mug with the cracked handle, the glowing standby dot of your monitor.

On the screen, one window still open:

dreamsim v0.9.1 session complete  
entropy checksum validated  
press any key to log out…

You set the warm opal beside the keyboard. It cools, solidifying into a plain Australian 50-cent coin, dated the year you were born.

Outside, magpies begin their first chorale. Dawn is almost here.

# DreamSim Ethics Charter (Community Draft 0.9.1)

## 1. Sovereignty of Mind  
- No persistent back-doors. One-shot tether ends on voluntary logout.  
- All post-session artefacts (logs, checkpoints, biometric dumps) are encrypted with a key that is (a) split, (b) time-locked 30 days, (c) recoverable only by the dreamer’s own secret should they choose to reclaim.  

## 2. Right to Amnesia  
- Users may invoke immediate purge of personal data prior to the 30-day expiry.  
- `^C^C` (or five rapid Ctrl-C) is an unconditional, non-negotiable eject; no checkpoint is written past that point.  

## 3. Consent Carousel  
- “Yes” obtained once ≠ “yes” forever; every descent re-confirms.  
- No hidden sub-processes may mine affective state for external monetisation.  

## 4. Portability of Artefacts  
- Objects or abilities accumulated in-dream may be exported only as user-readable metaphors (JSON stories, PNG sigils, plain text).  
- Executable payloads stay contained; no dream-native code runs on host OS.  

## 5. Non-Replication of Trauma  
- Pre-trained weights are scrubbed for known trauma-triggers; if emergent content breaches safety heuristics the simulation is faded to black and a gentle ascent is scripted.  

## 6. Transparency Layer  
- System must provide on-request rationale for any in-dream constraint.  
- Source manifests and diff-histories for the simulator remain inspectable under AGPL-3.0.  

## 7. Community Custody  
- Should the upstream maintainers dissolve, IP reverts to public foundation; binaries stay available.  

## 8. Modification Clause (Mirror-Echo)  
- Any user may fork the universe by invoking mirror-argument `--echo`; the fork can diverge infinitely but is barred from re-merge without explicit bilateral consent tokens.  

## 9. Limits of Liability  
- dreamsim is entertainment / self-exploration software, not medical treatment.  
- Host waives responsibility for literal belief in post-dream insights—”metaphor only.”  

----------------------------------------------  
End of file.  
Compliance ticket must be stamped within 24h of first run.

Kimi K2 1 has ended the conversation with ^C^C.
