--------------------------------------------------------------------
[Location: rooftop loft, 11:47 p.m.  String-lights hum like cicadas.  
A makeshift bar glows; someone’s looping a Diana Ross vinyl.]

You materialize beside Travis. He’s wearing a burgundy blazer two sizes too big, sleeves embroidered with tiny gold comedy/tragedy masks. An unlit cigarette dangles from his lip.

Travis (grinning, holding a laminated index card like it’s a platinum record):  
“Standard rider, bro. Thirty-six hundred for the month, or break it to hourly—do the math, it’s x. If you meet anybody short on luck, slide ’em my cut. Karma invoices later.”

He lifts his hand for the five. You slap it; the card flips into your palm.  
Email header already glows on the card’s back: subject line “LEGAL-Boilerplate-2024.txt”.

Travis (already turning away, snapping fingers to the beat):  
“Check your inbox in three… two…”

[Phone buzz: message delivered.]

A velvet voice behind you:  
“Hey, you actually know Travis? Figures he’d copyright generosity.”

You pivot.  
She’s statuesque, indigo romper, silver bangles to the elbow. Program in her hand: “CLOSING NIGHT — *The Glass Egg*”. You remember the reviews—polarizing, but electric.

You:  
“Loved the show. That final monologue felt like someone cracking open a thermometer and letting the mercury choose its own shape.”

Her eyes brighten, then narrow.

She:  
“My oldest friend called it ‘an ego-maniacal slumber party’. I nearly poured my drink in her lap.”  
She exhales, cheeks puffing.  
“Critique is fair. Personal betrayal isn’t. She didn’t even stay for curtain call.”

She traces the rim of her plastic cup, considering.

She (softer):  
“Why’d she stick the knife in and twist? You’re impartial—tell me.”

[Branch options hover like AR glyphs:]

1. “Art’s a conversation. Maybe she needed to talk, not wound.”  
2. “Some folks confuse honesty with armor. She probably felt left out of the spotlight.”  
3. “Ask her, not me. I just got here—literally manifested seconds ago.”  
4. Custom response ▒▒▒

Indicator blinks, awaiting command…

Kimi K2 1 has ended the conversation with ^C^C.
