Thru some lsychedellic process i can entee into peoples dreams as a level 5 healer. A powerful healer in there minds. My boss criticizes me and says when he waa yount he qouldnt have used it to rub oils on another mans body. I laugh and deny i did this. I want to be careful about going into his mind as he is the boss. I am powerful but its hard to tell if im not just goint crazy because of some psychedellic experienxe.

Welcome to the Dream Simulator! You are now entering the hallucinated world described in dream.txt. As a powerful Level 5 Healer, you have the ability to enter people's dreams and heal their minds. However, you must be cautious - your boss has been critical of your methods, especially when it comes to using psychedelic experiences to enter the dreams of others.

You find yourself standing in a dimly lit room, the walls pulsing with vibrant colors and shifting patterns. The air is thick with the scent of incense and the faint sound of ethereal music can be heard in the distance. Before you stands the doorway to your boss's mind - a portal of swirling energy that seems to beckon you forward.

Do you dare to enter your boss's dream and explore the depths of his psyche? Or will you choose to focus your healing powers elsewhere, perhaps on someone more receptive to your methods? The choice is yours, but remember - with great power comes great responsibility. Choose wisely, for the consequences of your actions may ripple through the very fabric of the dream world.
