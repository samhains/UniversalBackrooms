Silver ingots\u2014cold, weighty\u2014gleam in dusty trophy cases; seven cheap plastic trinkets pulse magnetically through beige corridors that multiply behind you. Gregor\u2019s fake collapse, seventeen-second slow-motion wink, and the weeping lama\u2019s silver tears mark betrayal. Bone-click herald: the Skeleton King, crown of shadows and burning sockets, seeps through walls and elevator brass, chasing the ingot-thief. Elevator moves sideways through non-Euclidean floors; buttons swim. Wake button\u2014final anchor\u2014yanks you out just as ivory fingers close."}
