simulator@anthropic:~$ ./dreamsim.exe "I'm in my wheelchair. A male instructor comes up to me and asks if I've been to the late evening sessions behind the stage. I say, "Not yet but I've heard they are interesting." He mentions one coming up, "Issack" or something. I say, "O.K., great! I'll be there." He leaves, all smiles. I'm sitting on the left hand corner in the back of an audience waiting for the show to start. Rosemary is behind me. She has 2 women friends with her. She's being very bossy. She'd see a situation and tell people what they need to do and where they need to sit, etc. I'm embarrassed. As the show starts, she moves away from me, like she's embarrassed for me. The show is set up like a three-ring circus. We applaud when they set up drums near our side. "Oh good," I say, "now I can see. I was worried." I say, "Oh! Are those the drums? They are huge!" They're so big, the performers sit in them. Many performers come out, a huge black man, and a huge black woman with 6 breasts. The "star," a young man with dark hair says, "Now there's a woman! Hey, big mama!" I am amazed. 2 older white guys sit down to sing an old folk tune. A woman sitting on my right sings with them. They sing very softly so they can assist her to sing. She's embarrassed and can't remember all the words. I'm a little envious. I'd like to sing too but I don't know the song. The performers throw gifts out to the audience. I catch a bunch of small Hershey bars. I pass them out to others, Rosemary, my "daughter," and others. Then I catch some spearmint gum and pass them out, keeping one for myself. I've become the contact person in my area of the audience. I look in my purse and separate all my little presents into one section. I have necklace chains that have static electricity in them, little earrings, one shaped like false teeth, little costume jewelry pins, candy canes and some other stuff. A young black boy hands out an outfit for a 13 month old baby. I hold it up to my daughter. "Will it fit?" She says, "I think it will." I question it. I decide it doesn't and give it back to the boy. He says, "Hang it on the Xmas tree and someone else will want it." I feel like I'd like to keep it but that it wouldn't be fair to others. I think about having a garage sale and selling the things I don't want to keep."

an authoritative tone.

The performers are still setting up. Crew members are placing enormous drums near
your section of the audience.

DreamSim 3.4.2 [Running]
------------------------------------

You look around from your wheelchair position in the back left corner.

The auditorium is large and buzzing with pre-show energy. The stage is elaborate with multiple performance areas - like a three-ring circus setup. Enormous drums are being positioned near your section.

Behind you is Rosemary with her two friends. She's gesturing and directing people with authority, occasionally causing other audience members to look uncomfortable.

To your right sits a woman who seems a bit shy, looking through a program. There are various people filling the seats around you.

In the distance, you can see performers preparing backstage, some in elaborate costumes.
