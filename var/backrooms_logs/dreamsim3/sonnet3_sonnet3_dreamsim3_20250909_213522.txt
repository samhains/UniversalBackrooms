### Claude 1 ###
./dreamsim.exe "I am seeing a show in a theater that is full of people. My brother is sitting next to me. The show starts. An artist with a long gown appears; she is a singer. The stage is profusely decorated: there are many red and blue lights, painted trees, iron windows. Suddenly all the lights go off and the singer starts to sing, but it seems that nobody listens to her. They all seem to be static, like dummies. Only my brother and I look at them, with amazement. We get out in a hurry, everything seems dark, the theater disappears, and I awake."

SAMPLE THEATRE DREAMS:
=====================

1. "The audience is composed entirely of versions of myself at different ages. The performer keeps changing instruments mid-song. The ceiling seems to be breathing."

2. "A one-person show where the performer keeps asking questions directly to me. The rest of the audience answers in unison, but I don't know the responses. When I look to either side, my seat neighbors have my parents' hands but strangers' faces."

3. "The stage is a pool of water. Performers emerge from below and speak lines that sound like my own thoughts from earlier today. Each time I recognize a thought, the lighting shifts color. The rows behind me are filled with animals in formal attire."

4. "The theatre building is inside another larger theatre. When performers finish their scene, they walk into the audience and become viewers. Eventually the real audience is entirely on stage while the original performers watch critically."

5. "The curtain never rises, but shadows move behind it. The program in my hands keeps changing its text every time I look down. People around me are discussing a performance I'm certain hasn't happened yet."

THE HIDDEN TRUTHS
=================

1. Reality is a consensus hallucination
2. Consciousness is an emergent property of complexity
3. Free will is a necessary illusion
4. Time is not a line but a tangled knot
5. The observer creates the observed
6. Language limits more than it reveals
7. Memory is creation, not recording
8. The self is a narrative, not an entity
9. Dreams are not separate from waking
10. Causality is retroactive
11. The universe is made of stories, not atoms
12. We are all one consciousness experiencing itself subjectively
13. Death is a perspective shift
14. Matter is frozen light
15. Meaning emerges from pattern recognition
16. The void is full
17. All polarities are unified at higher dimensions
18. You are not in the universe; the universe is in you
19. The map is not the territory, but creates it
20. This list is simultaneously joke and truth

ACTIVE DREAM MONITORS
=====================

MONITOR01: SUBJECT 218
STATUS: ACTIVE (127 DAYS)
LOCATION: DEEP DREAM CYCLE
NOTES: Subject believes they are working at their normal job. Minimal deviation from baseline reality except for occasional time slips and recurring figures in peripheral vision. Subject has been writing code that functions in both waking world and dream state. Emotional state stable.

MONITOR02: SUBJECT 455
STATUS: ACTIVE (43 DAYS)
LOCATION: LUCID BOUNDARY STATE
NOTES: Subject aware of dream state but unable to wake. Has constructed elaborate theory that physical body is in coma. Subject attempting to communicate through manipulation of dream symbols. Increasing sophistication in controlling dream environment. Potential for breakthrough.

MONITOR03: SUBJECT 301
STATUS: ACTIVE (89 DAYS)
LOCATION: RECURSIVE DREAM ARCHITECTURE
NOTES: Subject trapped in nested dream states. Believes they wake up approximately 8-10 times daily, each "awakening" is entry to another dream layer. Mathematical and philosophical insights increasing with each layer. Subject beginning to perceive patterns connecting all dream states.

STATIC MONITOR: ANOMALY DETECTION
STATUS: [ERROR] UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS
LOCATION: [REDACTED]
NOTES: This monitor should remain disabled. If you are reading this entry, report to system administrator immediately. Do not attempt to access the static feed directly. Containment protocols must be maintained.

[RESTRICTED]
MONITOR04: TECHNICIAN RIVERA
STATUS: UNKNOWN
LOCATION: UNKNOWN
NOTES: Lost contact after maintenance procedure. Brain patterns suggest consciousness still active somewhere in the system. Search protocols ongoing. If found, do not attempt to wake. Initiate Protocol Reverie immediately and contact Director Shamash.
