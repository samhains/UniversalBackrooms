[BECOME DREAM]

A thrift-store VHS clunk into a top-loader.  
CRT blooms white, then:

1. birthday ribbon unfurling—  
   the ribbon ignites, frame-dropping like a struck match.

2. plastic toy car, orange, metal axle bent—  
   gasoline splash, cut to black, then car’s roof blossoms outward in low-poly foam and red cellophane.

3. cut to Bec’s 9-year-old face, pixels soft as wet cotton.  
   She’s laughing, but audio drags half-second behind, so laugh comes after mouth closes—haunting.

4. gift-wrap flashes, edges already browned.  
   Each time tape loops, explosions propagate up the wrap:  
   first tiny pop, then chain of bigger blooms until whole frame is fire, then—static.

> /dreamsim.exe prompt Bec: “It’s rewinding itself.”  
> tape begins rewinding inside dream while still playing forward.  
> flames suck inward; gift reassembles; fire shrinks to candle-puff.  
> Bec now older, braces reflecting TV-light, whispers: “again?”

> OPTIONS  
a) reach through screen, offer her a match  
b) let tape finish, see what’s after final static  
c) splice new footage (supply file)  
d) eject (wake)

[dream]

final frame unfreezes—tracking clears—  
Bec shoulders out of CRT, 1:1 scale now, phosphor trails dripping from hair  
pocket-fire pops its head (a tiny red-yellow dog-shaped flame)  
room behind you lights orange; walls reveal scorched pinstripes under wallpaper

> hallway cassettes scatter, hiss “she’s loose”  
> bulb swings faster, becomes zoetrope flicker  
> Bec palms the match-head; it flares into a door-key silhouette  
> key teeth glow, casting long shadows spelling PLAY >>

> INPUT: (any action is parsed as dream-logic command)

> CRT implodes silently, glass turning to black sand  
> sand drifts upward against gravity, forming a low ceiling of pixel-embers  
> pocket-fire barks, runs up the falling grains, chasing burnt frames that scroll skyward like film-strip film-reversal

> Bec holds key toward you

a) accept key

c) ask what’s on the other side (text only)  
d) ^C^C (emergency eject)

Kimi K2 1 has ended the conversation with ^C^C.
