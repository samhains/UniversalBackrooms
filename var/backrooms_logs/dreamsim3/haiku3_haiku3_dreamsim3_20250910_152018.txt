### Round 1/30

### Claude 1 ###
simulator@anthropic:~$ ./dreamsim.exe "with young thug in a huge park in Brooklyn a and speaking to his manager who says that he is taking an absurd amount of drug we were standing around saying how nice he was acting .  He said it was like deathly amounts , he is about to do therapy. Im surprised that he is revealing this information to me and I suspect that I have in been mistaken for someone.  I am wearing blue jeans and a white shirt and I notice that I am a taller than everyone else. About to start they stop because in the sky there are these 2 fleets of warships that begin to enter the sky , one of them looks like a fleet of giant flying spiked handguns with large barrels and very small thin handles which are painted in American flag colors. I road my bike to the park but I start running to safety and there are surreal explosions. A plane falls nearby and explodes and the sound is delayed and profound parts fly close. I am running extremely fast . I think about how I'm looking forward to seeing footage of this absurd site on YouTube when it is over."
