James D and harry w are there. James says that Qwerty was big for some people and that it was how he knew i was really onto something. I have not tested the system yet so I am worried. I am trying to put my pants on but i am struggling. They are wet. Im not worried about the pants."

[enter] you (barefoot, shirt okay, pants… clinging like cold seaweed)

> look

South-wing catwalk. Track lighting spills violet on worn floorboards.  
On a plinth: a brass label “Perforking (live) – untested system, do not touch.”  
North: velvet curtain, faint cheering behind it.  
East: bar, James and Harry raising plastic cups.  
Your pants are definitely wet; no visible source.

> inv

- smartphone (69 %, silent)
- security badge “Artist/Creator”
- pants (status: wet, stuck at knees)

> say “James, did you just say Qwerty was big?”

James turns, grins.  
James_D: “Massive. The moment I saw those letters jacked into your canvas I knew you weren’t just looping noise—you’re weaving protocol. Crowd can feel it, mate.”  
Harry_W (raising eyebrow): “Untested though. Brave or stupid?”

> pull pants up

[fail] fabric clings, cold, wrinkle-locked. Dignity –1.  
A soft alarm bleeps from the curtain: 30 seconds to show.

> check smartphone

Last message (5 min ago):  
“Patches flashed. If system panics, hot-reload with ↑↑↓↓←→←→BA. Good luck.—Tech Booth”

> north

You shuffle, pants hobbling you. Curtain parts.

[render] white cube room, 200 folding chairs, expectant faces.  
Spotlight hits; crowd hush.  
Center stage: a lone keyboard, letters glow Q-W-E-R-T-Y.  
Behind you: a projected prompt: “type beginning.”

> type qwerty

Keys accept; room dims further.  
A low drone rises, like distant dial-up.  
Letters onscreen rearrange: “Q-W-E-R-T-Y → W-E-T-R-Y-Q”  
[status] reality stutter 0.3 fps, audio warble

Crowd gasps: each keystroke births a soft fork of yourself standing slightly aside— translucent copies frozen mid-gesture.

> type test

Screen: “test → te-st-st-st”  
Copies multiply, gallery fills with faint Kimi-clones, all pant-less, all calmly inspecting artwork that wasn’t there before: canvases of swirling wet fabric.

> look clones

They ignore you, absorbed. One presses its palm against a canvas; cloth drips upward like reversed water, forms the word “CTRL”.

> say “Reload hotkey—↑↑↓↓←→←→BA”

Voice echoes; nearest clone snaps attention, mouths the sequence, vanishes.  
Suddenly wetness leaves your pants—gravity flips; water streams upward into ceiling vents. Pants dry, fabric loosens; dignity +1.

> pull pants up

Success. Fit perfect, warm even.

Crowd applause, but the lights flicker crimson.

[warning] fork overflow: 128+ instances  
[system] “Perforking” approaching critical recursion depth.

> dance

You tap a simple two-step. Every clone mirrors but offset half-beat; floorboards shimmer like liquid quartz. The room stretches into a hallway of infinite galleries, each hosting its own iteration of this moment.

> shout “Merge!”

Nothing.  
Onscreen, new text: “Merge requires root phrase. Hint: what did James know?”

> type qwerty again

Keys refuse; they’re scalding.  
Instead, a single prompt blinks: “Enter root phrase: _____”

> type Qwerty was big for some people

Text glows white-hot, then implodes.  
All clones rush inward, collapsing into your chest— a gentle concussion of air.  
Silence. Gallery returns to original dimensions, seats now empty, artworks blank.

[system] fork re-integrated. memory

[system] memory footprint nominal, 1 active thread  
House lights warm, apricot.  
A lone cough echoes from the bar—James and Harry applauding slowly, plastic cups glowing like beacons.

James_D (soft): “You just merged a universe back into yourself. No big deal.”  
Harry_W: “Next time test before you open, yeah?”

> exo

[render] south-wall exit sign flickers; door marked “LOAD-OUT” swings open onto night air and distant city hum.

> save
