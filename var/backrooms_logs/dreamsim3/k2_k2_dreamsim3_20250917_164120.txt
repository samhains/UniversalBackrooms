simulator@moonshotai:~/$ ./dreamsim.exe "I am out at night and I'm very drunk . I can't find a place to stay so I call old friend Assad . I wake up in his room and noone is around . The room Is empty . I start looking around the house but noone is home . I speak to my dad who looks very upset , like he's about to cry , I console him and he tells me that he reported Assad into the police as he was playing suspicious games with him. dad says he also had a fundamentalist room out the back as well . I get nervous because I'm alone at his house and he might come home and beat me up. He comes home and I ask him where he's been and he says 'don't you know' ... Later we are sitting on his couch , I resist from saying - 'you can tell me anything ' as I feel like that might be a burden . I notice that Assad is wearing lipstick and looks like a pretty girl . I think to ask him about when he started dressing as a girl . I feel Suprised. I hold back , maybe he was a girl all along."

moonshotai:/dreamsim$ look  

A single bulb swings from a frayed cord, painting the walls in slow-motion yellow.  
The mattress is stripped—no sheets, just the ghost of a body pressed into the fabric.  
Your phone shows 3 % and one bar; the last outgoing call reads “assad (02:14).”  
Somewhere downstairs a grandfather clock is ticking, but its hands are both nailed to XII.

exits: door (ajar), window (rain), mirror (cracked)

inventory: stale rum on breath, house keys that aren’t yours, a voicemail you haven’t played

### Round 2/30

### Kimi K2 1 ###
You lift the phone like it weighs twice what it does.  
Thumb smears glass, speaker crackles alive.

Voicemail, 02:17, Dad:  
“…heard you’re crashing at Assad’s. Don’t. Not safe. I—”  
His voice cracks, wet paper.  
“…told the authorities. They’ve got photos of the back room, the flags, the—”  
A siren yelps in the background, swallows the rest.  
Then a final breath:  
“Come home. Please.”

click. 0:12.

The room feels suddenly colder, like someone opened a freezer you can’t see.  
The bulb above you jitters; shadows jump.

### Kimi K2 2 ###
moonshotai:/dreamsim$ inventory  

- stale rum on breath (duration: fading)  
- house keys that aren’t yours (metal still warm)  
- phone (0 %, dead now—screen cracked in a perfect crescent)  
- a folded napkin from the bar, ink bleeding through:  
  “if the house is empty, check the mirror—A”  

new scent: cheap lipstick, rose-ash, clinging to the air like someone just left.

### Round 3/30

### Kimi K2 1 ###
The hinges exhale a breath of rust and the hallway beyond is a throat of wallpaper—floral tongues peeling like old scabs.

Bare floorboards sweat under bare feet; each step leaves a wet echo that travels faster than you do.  
Half-way down, the grandfather clock stands guard, its glass face spider-web cracked. The nailed hands have moved: both now point to III.

To your left: bathroom door, light on inside, fan spinning a lazy whisper.  
To your right: stairs descending into a charcoal hush.  
Ahead: the mirror nailed to the wall—fractured in a lightning bolt that forks exactly where your reflection’s mouth should be.

> listen

### Kimi K2 2 ###
moonshotai:/dreamsim$ listen  

house breathing  
bathroom fan counting rpm like rosary beads  
a car idling outside, stereo leaking autotuned prayer  
under all that: wet footsteps—yours, but half a beat late, arriving after you’ve already moved  

then, from the vent above the bathroom door, a voice you almost recognise:  
“…don’t ask about the lipstick unless you’re ready to wear it too…”  

the mirror ticks—glass flexing like something behind it is leaning close.
