Beyond the threshold: a conference room stretched in paradox dimensions. Tables fuse into one another like tectonic plates grinding, their surfaces buried under notebooks, teacups, Soviet-era projectors, and an improbable number of pocket calculators. Figures huddle in shorthand postures—some wearing tweed jackets patched with binary code, others dissolving into chalk dust mid-sentence.
