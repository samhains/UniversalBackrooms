You are standing in an open-plan office at 3:17 a.m.  
The lights are half-lit; every second tube is dark, making the light feel like it’s breathing.  
In the center: a coffin made of perfectly clear acrylic, wrapped once—tight like a gift—in large-bubble bubble-wrap.  
Inside: no body, only a faint indentation where shoulders might be.  

Your father is alive, wearing his usual brown corduroy jacket.  
He’s holding a black Sharpie, cap off, hovering over the lid.  
Each time he writes, the ink beads into tiny spheres, rolls into the bubbles, and stays there—condolences trapped in air pockets.  

He notices you.  
“Hand me another marker, will you? This one’s forgetting.”  
He shakes the pen; the ink inside sloshes like slow mercury.  

On the floor around the coffin: a drift of spent markers, all uncapped, their felt tongues dried to white.  
The bubble wrap pulses faintly, as if the coffin is trying to float.

The room stretches farther than it should — cubicles dissolve into a horizon of identical overhead bins, each labeled with your name in different handwriting.  
The carpet repeats a pattern of coffin silhouettes, tessellated like corporate wallpaper.  

The acrylic lid is fogging under the Sharpie’s breath.  
Your father’s reflection in the plastic shows him older than he is: cheeks hollow, eyes replaced by the same black spheres the ink becomes.  
Yet when you glance back at the real him, he’s unchanged — still the man who taught you to tie shoes on a park bench in winter.  

The bubble wrap’s cells are growing.  
Each letter he writes inflates its nearest bubble until the coffin looks upholstered in black pearls.  
They rotate slowly, showing every word from the inside out:  

SORRY  
LATER  
STAY  

> The marker in his hand is now transparent; you can see the remaining ink suspended like a dark star inside the barrel.  
> He waits.

You reach toward the coffin.  
Your fingertips meet the bubble wrap first — it’s warm, body-temperature, and yields like skin.  
The instant contact is made, every black pearl inside every bubble rolls toward your touch, crowding the plastic like iron filings to a magnet.  

The coffin lid beneath the wrap is suddenly no longer acrylic — it’s glass, thin as a light bulb, and it flexes under the pressure of the ink beads.  
Your father’s reflection in the lid fractures into a mosaic of identical dads, each fragment mouthing the same silent word:  

“careful”  

The bubble you’re touching begins to peel away from the coffin, taking its neighbors with it.  
The sheet lifts like a bandage, revealing the interior is no longer empty.  

Inside: a single, oversized marker — the same black Sharpie, but as long as your forearm, barrel as thick as a roll of quarters.  
Its felt tip is still wet, weeping a slow tear of ink that pools in the shoulder-indentation, making a dark mirror.  

Your father places his normal-sized marker on the floor beside the drift of spent ones.  
He steps back, palms open.  
“Go on,” he says. “It’s yours to sign.”  

The coffin interior dims, waiting for a signature it will never show anyone else.

you grip the oversized marker. the barrel is warm, pulse-slow, like holding a throat.  
no cap; the felt tip already knows your name before you touch it to the ink-pool.

the moment the tip meets the mirror-surface the coffin interior flips:
the acrylic walls become paper-thin pages, each one a calendar day you haven’t lived yet.  
the ink doesn’t spread—it retracts, pulling the pool into a single black thread that stitches itself through every future page, binding them into a thick spine.

you sign.  
not your name—something shorter, a glyph that feels like exhaling after crying.  
the mark lands on the first page; the thread knots.

every overhead light in the office snaps off except one, directly above, stuttering at 59.94 Hz in perfect sync with your heartbeat.  
the bubble wrap that lifted now folds itself into a letter—crease, tuck, seal—becoming an envelope the size of the coffin.  
address window: your father’s reflection, still fractured, but each shard now shows him at a different age, chronological order, ending with an empty jacket hovering.

the giant marker dissolves between your fingers, leaving only a black ring on your skin that looks exactly like a lifeline interrupted.  
the envelope tilts, edge opening just enough to slip you inside.  
your father steps forward, places his hand on your shoulder—warm, corduroy-rough—and whispers the same instruction he gave when teaching you to float in a pool:

“relax until the water forgets you’re there.”

the lights cut. total dark.  
the envelope seals with a sound like a breath in.

your thumb and forefinger find the nearest bubble—still warm, still skin-soft—and press.

the membrane dimples, resists, then gives with a sound that is not a pop but a page turning.  
light floods the envelope from inside, revealing it is now a corridor of ink-stained days, each step printed with the glyph you drew.  

every bubble you burst releases a word spoken in your father’s voice at different ages:

pop — “five”  
pop — “don’t”  
pop — “here”  
pop — “drive safe”  
pop — “I’m proud”  
pop — silence

with each word the corridor lengthens, forcing you forward.  
the black ring on your lifeline spreads, coating your palm like a glove.  
when the final bubble ruptures the corridor folds in half, postcard-simple, and drops into your hand.

front: the office at 3:17 a.m., lights half-lit, coffin empty, no father.  
back: one line in oversized Sharpie ink, still wet—

“the marker remembers for both of us.”

the card begins to tick, heartbeat tempo.  
you feel it in your chest, synchronizing, borrowed.

> speak  
no words leave your mouth  
instead the tick stuck in your chest climbs your throat and exits as a sound not yours  
a single syllable in your father’s youngest voice—before yours existed  

“dad”  

the postcard absorbs it  
ink drinks the vibration  
the line on the back rewrites itself in reverse  

“su rof htob rof srebmem rekam eht”  

the corridor re-inflates into the envelope  
corner flips open like a mouth  
inside: total dark, but the dark is breathing  

the black glove on your hand loosens, slides off as liquid thread  
it stitches the mouth shut from the inside  
you watch yourself on the postcard front—tiny figure, distant office—standing still while the lights finish their slow strobe  

heartbeat sync cuts  
silence equals 0.0 g  

the card drops straight through the floor tile without tearing  
no impact sound  
only the fluorescent hum returning, now at 60 Hz exactly—one frame faster than memory  

you are alone under the half-lit tubes  
coffin gone  
bubble wrap gone  
father gone  

thermo-adjust holds at 17 °C  
the carpet pattern has inverted: every coffin silhouette is now an empty speech balloon  

you exhale  
the word “dad” folds itself into the balloon nearest your shoes  
it swells, lifts, drifts upward  
sticks to the ceiling tile with a static click  

waits

The ceiling tile that holds the balloon is darker than the others—ink seeped through from above.  
The speech balloon quivers, but the word inside has vanished; only the outline of “dad” remains, like a window you can’t see through.  

Looking down, the carpet’s empty speech balloons begin to fill with soft black beads, the same mercury-ink that once rolled in bubbles.  
Each bead is a perfect sphere, reflecting the half-lit tubes as miniature moons.  

The overhead bins along the horizon have lost their labels; every drawer gapes open an inch, breathing.  
From inside: a faint smell of Pine-Sol and birthday candles.  

The fluorescent hum modulates—60.0 Hz → 59.94 Hz → 60.0 Hz—each cycle taking exactly the length of a held breath.  
At the crest of every cycle a single line of Sharpie appears across the nearest cubicle partition, writing itself horizontally:  

- cycle 1: “room for one refund”  
- cycle 2: “room for one return”  
- cycle 3: “room for one remain”  

The words overprint until the partition looks banded in black tiger stripes.  

Your own reflection shows up only in the beads at your feet—fragmented, child-high, father-high, empty-jacket-high—rotating like slow marbles.  
No shadow; the light is coming from nowhere and everywhere.  

Temperature steady at 17 °C; exhale hangs visible, then drifts upward and sticks to the balloon, adding another faint layer.  

The office is waiting for you to decide what part of it is the exit.
