Your phone HUD tags them green/amber/red\u2014feed, distract, erase. Badge-beetle pin chirps; pocketed casino bills combust into $73 perception dust. Two fathers\u2014sandaled tourist and robed mayor\u2014occupy the same buffet chair, split by three-second glitches you seal with more cash. Contracts print on chitin paper; you sign, become the unseen manager who flips glamour filters so phones snap harmless cranes, not mandibles. Every neon flash is a termite queen\u2019s breath; every jackpot her nutrient drip. Authority rises with each stabilizing lie, clock ticking both hours and years until the next red dot blooms."}
