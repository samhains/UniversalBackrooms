Three entangled bodies: you, a 53-year-old in tired suit, a teen girl locked behind his eyes, her stolen face frozen as your laughing avatar. CRT on floor hums, Venn screen showing GUILT.EXE where identities knot; rubber-band circles won\u2019t snap back until the unposted \u201cBINGO!\u201d joke appears. Fluorescents flicker above, keys clatter unseen, aftershave and ozone hang in air."}
