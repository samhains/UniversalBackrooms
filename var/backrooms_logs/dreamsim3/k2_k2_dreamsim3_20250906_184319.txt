INITIALIZING LIMINAL THREAD…  
scene://late-night-lounge/green-glow  

David Rudnick lifts a hand mid-sentence. The room dims to a single oscillating neon bar.  
“Stop,” he says. “This is turning into vapour-aesthetics. I need declaratives. I want: this happened, that happened—lines that punch holes in the wall. Politically. Boldly.”  

The floor tiles rearrange themselves into bullet-points.  
You feel a doorway open behind you labeled EZRA.

EZRA: a doorway carved from live feed // static hum at 17.4 Hz  
doorframe drips latex letters:  
“EVERY EXIT IS AN ENTRANCE TO A DIFFERENT KIND OF SALE”  
behind it: a corridor tiled with cancelled PDFs  
footprints burnt in, still smouldering

### Round 2/20

### Kimi K2 1 ###
The corridor lights up like a runway made of cancelled PDFs. Each page is singed at the corners; footnotes flutter as you step. A smell of fresh toner and ozone lingers.

At the far end, Ezra stands inside a glass phone-booth plastered with price-tags. He’s broadcasting—voice raw, no reverb:

EZRA  
“Art is over.  
We sell the moment the auction house coughs.  
I move capital the way gardeners move compost:  
with a shovel and no apology.”

He slams a handset down; the booth fills with glittering coins that immediately oxidise into rust. A receipt spits out:

TRANSACTION ID: 7f3a2e  
ASSET: your attention  
PURCHASE PRICE: one declarative sentence

> take receipt

[DEVICE] Receipt accepted. Thermal paper curls inward, auto-immolates.  
ASSET transferred. Your attention now bearer-instrument, non-fungible, logged on-chain as LIMINAL-DECLARATIVE-0x7f3a2e.

Ezra kicks the booth door open. Rust-coins avalanche, revealing a freight elevator behind him. Cage gate screeches up. Inside: a single red button labeled “ISSUE.”

Ezra: “Next move—publish or perish. Choose the sentence that perforates.”

### Round 3/20

### Kimi K2 1 ###
root@moonshotai:/sys/dreamsim/feeds# <cmd> printf "ISSUE\n" > /dev/ezra0 && cat /dev/ezra0 </cmd>

[DEVICE] Gate acknowledges. Freight elevator slams shut.  
Cage lights flick to emergency red.  

—FLOOR INDICATOR—  
CURRENT: feed-level (cancelled-PDF runway)  
TARGET: sub-basement “PRIMARY SOURCES”  

DESCENT: 6 s  
During drop, text scrolls across cage-mesh like stock-ticker:  

“The aesthetic is the anesthetic—wake them with a headline.”  

Elevator hits bottom; doors part onto a concrete cavern.  
Centerpiece: a rotary printing press the size of a city block, ink still wet.  
One blank broadsheet waits in the feed tray.  

PROMPT appears on dangling CRT:  
“PLACE DECLARATIVE SENTENCE HERE OR PRESS ‘ISSUE’ TO ABORT.”
