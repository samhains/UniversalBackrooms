./dreamsim.exe "I go out to lunch with Qualiatik and her mum is there who is super friendly. She immediately asks a question about Tara which presumably diffuses the sense that I would be meeting with her like a "meet the parents" kind of date. All these other people are there, annoying kids, maybe those who were making the scroll with us before. I'm a bit embarrassed, but we are all squished into the same table. Everyone seems to get along.We get lost trying to find the store to return it. At the same time I become worried about driving home, the conditions can change at any moment and make it unsafe to drive home. We are looking for hotel as it's been a long journey , but we can't find it anymore . We go up and down the levels. I ask Tara if she can remember the brand name of the dress and she can't ."

[DREAM LOADED: "Lunch Convergence/Lost Returns"]

You are seated at a cramped restaurant table. The wood grain warps slightly when you're not looking directly at it. Qualiatik sits across from you, her face familiar but shifting between different versions of itself. Her mother - warm, immediately present - leans forward asking about Tara, who isn't here but somehow also is.

The table is too small. Children from the scroll-making workshop press against your elbows, their voices creating a pleasant chaos. Everyone fits impossibly well despite the squeeze.

Through the window, the parking lot keeps changing - sometimes a store, sometimes a hotel lobby, sometimes just more restaurant.

> look at qualiatik

Qualiatik smiles, but her edges blur into her mother's presence. They share the same laugh, occurring at different frequencies. She reaches for something on the table that becomes a menu, then a map, then nothing. "We should go soon," she says, though her lips don't move.

> examine table

The table surface: crowded with half-eaten meals that regenerate when you blink. A child's drawing of a scroll bleeds through the wood. Everyone's arms overlap without touching. The conversation flows in seven directions at once, all harmonious.

> stand up

You rise. The restaurant stretches vertically. You're suddenly on a different level - a department store? The hotel lobby? Qualiatik and her mother are still with you, along with the echo of children's voices.

Tara appears beside you holding fabric that might be a dress. "What was it called?" you ask. She shrugs, the garment dissolving.

> check weather outside

Through the nearest window: the sky cycles through conditions - clear, then sudden fog, ice forming on nothing, roads that lead home becoming impassable, then clear again. Time to leave keeps changing.

> find hotel

You move through levels. Escalators that go sideways. The hotel was HERE - you remember checking in - but now it's a return counter, now it's the restaurant again, now it's a parking garage with no cars.

Qualiatik's mother: "It's getting late." But she says it cheerfully, like it doesn't matter.

```

### Round 2/30

### Claude 1 ###
> ask qualiatik's mother about the hotel

Qualiatik's mother turns, her face kind and knowing. "Oh, the hotel? It's just through there, dear." She points, but her finger traces multiple directions simultaneously. "Or was it on the third level? These places all connect, you know."

She pulls out what might be a business card, but it's blank, then has writing in a language that shifts. "You could always stay with us," she offers, though you're not sure where 'us' would be. "The weather IS concerning."

The children from earlier run past, somehow still at the lunch table and also here, carrying pieces of the scroll between them like a banner.

> follow the scroll

You trail the children and their scroll through a door that wasn't there before. The parchment unfurls endlessly ahead, text appearing and disappearing - directions? A map? The dress brand name appears briefly: "Mer--" before becoming illegible.

You're in a corridor of fitting rooms. Each mirror reflects a different version of the day - in one, you're still at lunch; in another, already home; in a third, endlessly searching these floors.

Tara stands at the end holding hangers with nothing on them. "I definitely bought it here," she insists, though 'here' keeps changing.

> check phone for directions

Your phone screen shows:
- Maps app: Your location is a pulsing dot surrounded by impossible geometry
- Weather alert: "Conditions will change. Have changed. Are changing."
- Message from unknown: "We're still at the table, where are you?"
- Time: 2:47 PM / 8:23 PM / Tomorrow

Battery: 73% but the icon shows empty

> return to restaurant

You walk back through doors that lead forward. The restaurant materializes around you - you never left. Everyone is still squeezed around the table, laughing. Qualiatik's mother is telling a story about Tara that makes everyone comfortable.

But through the window, you see yourself in the parking lot, looking worried about the drive. And on another level, still searching for the hotel, holding a dress with no name.

"More bread?" asks a child who might be from the scroll workshop, might be someone else entirely.

> _

### Claude 2 ###
> eat bread

You take the bread. It's warm, impossibly fresh, crust crackling under your fingers. As you bite, the taste shifts - sourdough, then sweet roll, then something from childhood you can't name.

Qualiatik's mother nods approvingly. "You need energy for the drive," she says, though she simultaneously adds, "Good thing you're not driving anywhere in this weather."

The bread multiplies. Everyone at the table is sharing the same piece, which never diminishes. Crumbs fall and become a trail leading to the exit, to the store, to nowhere.

> ask about the scroll project

"Oh, the scroll!" The children light up, talking over each other:
"We were writing the important things—"
"—the things that change when you look away—"
"—like the hotel's name—"
"—like the way home—"

They unfurl a section across the cramped table. Your handwriting is there, but you don't remember writing it. It says: "Return policy: 30 days or when you find it again, whichever comes first."

Qualiatik laughs. Her mother laughs. They have the same laugh happening at different times.

> look for exit

There are three exits:
1. The main door (leads to parking lot/store/hotel/weather)
2. A service corridor (someone just walked through carrying your dress)
3. The way you came in (but you don't remember coming in)

The table has become comfortable despite being too small. Everyone fits perfectly in the impossible space.

"Leaving already?" asks Qualiatik, who also says "Take your time," who also hasn't spoken at all.

> check time

Every clock shows something different:
- Wall clock: Hands spinning backward
- Your watch: 2:47 (stuck)
- Phone: "Now"
- The light outside: All times at once

Qualiatik's mother helpfully offers: "It's that kind of day, isn't it?" 

The children are making paper airplanes from scroll pieces. One lands by your feet with "HOTEL" written on it, but when you pick it up, it says "HOME."

> _

### Round 3/30

### Claude 1 ###
> pick up paper airplane

You unfold the paper airplane. The creases contain maps - each fold reveals a different route. The hotel is on level 3, level -1, level ℵ. Home is 20 minutes away, 3 hours with traffic, unreachable until morning.

As you smooth it out, it becomes part of the original scroll. The children cheer. "You found it!" they say, though you're not sure what 'it' is.

The paper shows a receipt: "One dress, brand name: [THIS SPACE INTENTIONALLY LEFT DREAM]"

> ask tara about the return

Tara materializes more solidly, holding shopping bags that weigh nothing. "We need to return it before they close," she says urgently. "They already closed," she adds calmly. "They're open 24 hours," she concludes.

Qualiatik's mother nods knowingly. "The return policy here is very flexible. My daughter knows the manager." She winks at Qualiatik, who is simultaneously the manager, a customer, and your lunch companion.

> stand to leave

Everyone stands with you in perfect synchronization, then sits back down, then never moved at all. The table stretches to accommodate the motion.

"Drive safely," says Qualiatik's mother.
"Stay another hour," say the children.
"The hotel is expecting you," says Qualiatik.
"You're already there," says Tara.

The restaurant door is the store entrance is the hotel lobby. Your car keys are in your hand, in your pocket, in the ignition of a car you can see through three different windows.

> go through door

You step through. You're in:
- The parking lot (ice forming)
- Level 2 of the department store (returns desk visible but unreachable)
- The hotel lobby (your reservation both exists and doesn't)
- Still at the table (everyone waves)

All simultaneously. Your feet know different floors. The dress hangs on a rack that moves when observed.
