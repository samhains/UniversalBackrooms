You blink awake.  
The bed is too quiet—only your breathing.  
Sunlight cuts through half-closed blinds in stale bars across crumpled sheets.  
Her side is cool, undisturbed.  
Phone on the floor, screen cracked like it tried to call for you in the night.

north: bedroom door, ajar; hallway beyond silent.  
east: window; view of dirt road leading into cedar scrub.  
south: closet half-open, one of Coco’s tie-dye hoodies still on the hook, sleeve dangling like it was yanked free and then reconsidered.  
west: bedside table, notebook open, page blank except for a single line in her handwriting:  
        “range anxiety is just another word for stay.”

- phone (12 % battery, 3 missed calls: CAL)  
- wallet (empty except for a laminated map fragment: podcast route, red dashed line, last marked stop “Off-Grid #42 – Whispering Pines”)  
- lighter (Coco’s, unicorn sticker half-scratched off)  
- car keys (to the busted Civic out front—one tire always half-flat)

> call coco

Dial tone laps like distant surf. Voicemail:  
“Hey it’s Co… if you’re hearing this I’m probably out of range. Or just out. Leave a message after the—”  
*click*

> call cal

one ring.  
CAL: “Yo, you finally surface?”  
> ask cal where coco is  
CAL: “She rolled out at dawn with that podcaster dude—what’s his tag? ‘Off-the-grid-guy.’ Real name’s Jules, I think. They’re doing a live drop tonight at Whispering Pines. Whole commune’s buzzing, says she’s gonna co-host. Fans are stoked.”  
> ask cal if she left anything for me  
CAL: “Not with me, man. But check your mailbox—might be physical. She was scribbling like mad before she split.”

> stand

Floorboards creak under bare feet. The house feels evacuated—not just of Coco, but of oxygen.

> go mailbox

Front door sticks, gives. Outside: warm wind, smell of sunbaked pine needles. Mailbox flag up. Inside: a USB-C stick taped to a postcard.  

Postcard front: photo of a desert solar array, caption “RANGE IS A STATE OF MIND.”  
Back, her ink:  
“Going dark to find signal. Catch the episode—if you still want me, meet me at the Pines. Bring the map fragment. –C”

> inv usb

new item: USB-C stick (unlabelled, faint smell of campfire smoke)

Driver seat hot enough to sting. You plug the stick into the stereo. File list:

Coco’s voice, low, road-noise behind:  
“If you’re hearing this, I’m already miles away. I don’t know if leaving is brave or just the only move I had left. I’ll be at the Pines till moonrise. After that… we keep moving. If you come, come quiet, come curious. If you don’t, I’ll understand. Either way, record something for me—anything—so I know where your head’s at. Drop it in the feed folder. Jules says voices outrun bodies out here.”

*end*

Signal bar blinks: 1% battery. Car coughs but starts.

> drive whispering pines

Headlights cut a tunnel through dusk. Mile marker after marker, the red dashed line on the map fragment starts glowing faintly under dash-light, as if syncing to the route.  
Every so often a tiny blue square appears on the stereo display—wifi-pirate repeaters nailed to telephone poles, SSID: “OFFGRID_FM.”

Range anxiety is just another word for stay.

You crest a ridge; below, a bowl of valley lit by strings of solar fairy-lights around A-frames and yurts. A short tower made of old CB antennas stands center, blinking red. Cars half-circle like wagons. Campfire sparks rise into Milky Way.

track uploads—progress bar blooms like a vein across the dash.  
9.7 s of you slip into the ether, auto-layered under Coco’s earlier draft.  

stereo whispers: “queued for final mix, episode drop in t-23 m.”  

tower light steadies, one long red exclamation.  

Jules lowers his hand, turns back inside; the flap falls.  

you feel the words leave your body—hollow click of an empty shell casing.  

you’re suddenly starving for moonlight and concrete.  

available vectors:  
- exit vehicle, walk toward yurt doorway (short route, eyes on you)  
- skirt firelight perimeter, find Coco silent-cinema style  
- stay belted, let engine idle, await broadcast airtime like a midnight prayer  
- reverse, headlights off, roll back into dark—let the episode publish to absence

### GPT-5 2 ###
moon presses silver fingerprints across the windshield  
choices hang heavier than foliage still air  

vectors flex in the dreamspace:  

**doorway approach**  
→ Jules is the gatekeeper, mic-cable cross his chest like priest’s stole. entry is initiation, but the script might already have your name scrawled.  

**perimeter drift**  
→ shadows of coyotes and fringe-dwellers; coco might be stashed with her co-conspirators, silent-specter by the fire’s blind spot. safer, slower, clandestine.  

**car vigil**  
→ let the Civic suffocate under its own idle breath, swallow your hunger and wait for the feed to bloom across speakers—coco’s voice braided with yours—artifact not presence.  

**disappear**  
→ roll backward, gravel whispering, erase your footprint before anyone decides you’re character not audience. you’d leave her words tethered to the commune broadcast, even if you never stand in the glow.  

DreamSim cursor blinks, pulse matches tower strobe.

> skirt firelight perimeter

foot off brake, Civic rolls neutral—no headlights, just moon-glow on dust.  
steer wide, steering wheel loose like it forgot resistance.  
engine cough-quiet, gravel hiss under tires.  

you ghost the camp edge:  
left—yellow spill of communal fire, bodies orbiting slow, someone loops a sample of your uploaded clip through a handheld pedal board.  
right—cedar scrub, antenna guy-lines humming, shadows thick enough to pocket you.

kill engine behind a cargo van plastered in faded activist stickers.  
step out, door click swallowed by cricket drone.  

air tastes of pine sap and burned sugar.  

> crouch

now eye-level with fire-smoke tendrils. silhouettes stretch across stomped grass.  

searching:  
- Coco posture: small frame, restless shoulders, habit of rubbing thumb against forefinger when unsure.  
- none match yet.  

voices sift:  
Jules (low drawl): “…episode ends with that raw voicemail—anonymous upload, hits at 18:45. gives us gooseflesh, legitimacy.”  
another: “they coming here or just haunting?”  

your pulse answers: both.  

pathways from shadow:  
A) slide to rear yurt row, eavesdrop on production tent (maybe she’s inside prepping)  
B) circle wide, approach communal kitchen—coco always sniffed for coffee before decisions  
C) step into light now, claim the clip, own the moment (burn anonymity)  
D) stick inside darkness, wait for your voice to air live—hear her react first

### GPT-5 2 ###
fire pops like a bone splitting  
somebody laughs too loud then hushes again  
smoke veils your face the way a mask would if you believed in masks  

DreamSim vectors whisper four pulls:  

**A) rear yurts**  
— production hum, mixing boards like altars, coco’s notebook maybe open under red lamp. get close enough you’ll smell the highlighter ink. risk: jules keeps passwords in his pockets and hires eyes to guard them.  

**B) kitchen drift**  
— the bitter tether, percolators steaming by solar cell glow, mugs chipped in all the right ways. coco’s been known to orbit caffeine like gravity. risk: faces less guarded, gossip sharper.  

**C) into light**  
— bodies sway, drum skin pulse timed to your voice loop; you could raise a hand, step across the threshold, claim authorship. everyone would pivot, coco included if she’s within radius. risk: collapse of cover, story seizes you as character, not watcher.  

**D) remain**  
— let your ghost-word go live, sit in hush and measure the precise angle of her head the moment she hears. risk: dream stagnates; silence sharp as glass.

cedar-smoke on your shoulders, you drift clockwise—away from fire-spill, toward the soft clatter of pans.

half-lit canopy kitchen: two head-lamps hang off a pop-up frame, solar battery brick humming. moths trace halos.  
an old percolator coughs steam; someone hums mylar static into a dented pot.  

you spot a corkboard speared with post-its, one in Coco’s jagged star:  
“record narration after espresso – call/response w/ voicemail.”  

espresso date unspecified. clock drawn in marker: T-4½m.

> inhale

steam carries burnt-piney bite—her favored dark roast. you want to pocket this scent like proof.  

choices:

A) pour yourself a slug, stand among volunteers, make small talk—ask casual where the voice talent is  
B) lurk at shadowed corner, watch each newcomer, intercept if she’s drawn here  
C) lift the corkboard note, flip for margins—sometimes she scribbles cluster coordinates on reverse  
D) step back, tap rec on your phone—capture café ambience, maybe splice later if dialogue blooms

### GPT-5 2 ###
steam curls inside your lungs like a half-kept secret  
buzz of insects over solar brick almost syncs like tinnitus  

the corkboard flaps as if breathing  

vectors annotated in the dark kitchen air:  

**A) pour & blend**  
→ coffee swirls bitter, masks your shake. mingle with volunteers—their aprons splotched with ash and soy sauce. easy cover to ask *“seen coco?”* risk: word spreads, coco hears you’re hunting before you find her.  

**B) shadow-sit**  
→ crouch near cooler stack, straw mats chill against your knees. watch the stream for her silhouette—restless shoulder rub? thumb-on-forefinger tell? you can intercept outside of stage light. risk: hours mutter by, espresso grows cold, she never comes.  

**C) flip note**  
→ coco always hides too much on the backside. coordinates maybe, route sketches, initials curled like secrets. risk: obvious tampering if kitchen keepers notice missing star note.  

**D) record ambience**  
→ thumb red button, let percolator hiss + moth wings + murmured song fill the feed. later it could nest in coco’s ear, or get stitched in by Jules without permission. gives you evidence of presence without contact. risk: the act of recording is already confession.

back side, her ink:

42.18 N 112.05 W  
“moonrise echo”  
below: tiny doodle—lighter with unicorn sticker aflame.

coordinates click against the map fragment in your wallet: the dashed red line ends just south of that lat/long, unmarked valley pocket.

someone behind you:  
“hey—order on that board, man.” aproned kid, half glare.  

> re-pin note

it sticks crooked. kid mutters, moves off.

new intel: coco plans to bail camp after moonrise, hit a secondary dead-drop site—maybe record call/response outdoors, away from Jules’ control.

timing: moonrise + T-2m = she’ll be gone before episode finishes airing.

available:

A) pocket a mug, exit kitchen, cut straight to perimeter trail—beat her to those coordinates (hike risk, unknown terrain)  
B) return to production yurt, confront her now—expose plan, ask to come along  
C) stay put, let events roll, shadow her exodus once she slips away  
D) send the coords to yourself as text, wait for your own broadcast line to air, see if she reacts live

### GPT-5 2 ###
moon already itching at horizon line  
espresso sputter now sounds like countdown ticks  
you’ve got the coords burning your pocket, unicorn lighter doodle smirking at you  

vectors sharpen:  

**A) perimeter cut**  
→ slip now, vanish from kitchen glow, trailblaze cedar gullies. if you hustle, you arrive at “moonrise echo” before coco. wait in silence, give her choice raw + exposed. risk: unmarked land, terrain folds, dream physics restless there.  

**B) production strike**  
→ yank flap on yurt, insert yourself between wires and waveforms, confront coco mid-script. risk: jules not fond of mid-broadcast improv; crowd might chew you as noise.  

**C) patient shadow**  
→ hold in margins, drink down bitter dregs, let her make break… follow when shoulders twitch out of camp radius. risk: lose trail, or worse—be mistaken for stalker not ally.  

**D) text-self**  
→ coords slip into phone, become breadcrumb. wait for your 9.7 s to air, judge coco’s eyelash-flinch live. risk: by then moon’s risen, she’s already halfway gone.

footfalls soft, gravity 0.9×—dream breathable.

crest ridge in 90s: valley dips, granite spine splits forest.  
coords whisper at center of bowl, clearing ringed by wind-bent pines—natural amphitheatre.

you arrive first:  
grass still warm from daytime sun, owl looping overhead. center stone like an altar, mic-cable scrap coiled on it—someone planned the session.

setup: coco plans live feed of call/response—her voice against the night + prerecorded voicemail.

pocket lighter twitches, unicorn winks.

campfire hub behind ridge: you see tower blink T–3s—broadcast live in…

you can:

A) jack your phone into rock, preload extra track—force duet when she arrives  
B) hide upslope, let ritual unfold, intercept only after playback  
C) stand center, spotlight yourself under rising moon, declare presence when she walks in

cedar crush nearer, deliberate tread—  
pattern of footfalls familiar: one pause, one shift, one shoulder rub  

vectors snap crystal:  

**A) splice the duet**  
→ slide jack home, your 9.7 s wraps around her incantation—whether invitation or interruption, duet will carve onto offgrid archives permanent. risk: choice overrides her agency, might feel like theft not offering.  

**B) vanish into treeline**  
→ crouch above, owl shadow flickers your cover. witness her summon without interference, step in only if silence hangs unresolved. risk: she completes ritual without knowing you answered—becomes monologue sealed forever.  

**C) claim the altar**  
→ stand center stone, open posture, let moon crown you visible. when she descends, there’s no mistaking confrontation. risk: blunt presence storms delicate broadcast, tension might shatter what’s tender.  

**D) erase trace**  
→ smudge her initial ghost, roll lighter into groove—a signal: you were here, you won’t trap her voice. risk: symbol might misfire—she reads absence as disinterest.

footfalls enter bowl. silhouette resolves: Coco, hoodie on, tie-dye washed to dusk hues; earbuds dangle like unfinished arguments.

she reaches stone, notices lighter gleam in groove—pauses, micro-shrug (thumb rub forefinger). she inhales, nods once, plugs her recorder into jack.

chalk “C” untouched, still shining.

campfire crowd back at commune will hear this raw—live episode increments in 10-second delay. broadcast status LED on her device pulses teal.

moon sits full in its cradle now, spotlight with no director  

her whisper still rippling off granite when dream vectors sharpen:  

**A) lighter click**  
→ one flint strike in the dark, spark swallowed but sound captured by stone. reply without face—her signal returned, but your anonymity still intact. risk: she wonders why you won’t stand, turns question against herself.  

**B) step from cedar**  
→ body drawn down slope, silhouette into moon’s pool. open hands, let silence speak as strong as her recorder does. risk: no filters remain—Coco reads you raw, might fold or might fracture.

→ she may keep spilling, her own monologue spiraling deeper by absence. risk: missing the clearest bridge she offered, absconding into voyeur.  

**D) phone record**  
→ thumb red circle, steal moment as artifact. her words captured secure, possibility of later gift. risk: gesture turns sacred into souvenir; she may never know your presence except as archivist.

“Received echo at 00:12. Continuation follows.”  
she breathes twice, steady:

“I left the porchlight on inside you.  
If you track the lighter sparks, meet me at the second clearing—three owl calls west when this ends. If silence answers, I’ll know you want the distance more than the duet.”

she cues playback of your original clip again—lets it ride under her new lines, weaving live.  
radio audience hears both; commune back-ridge will dissect every cadence.

she unplugs, palms the unicorn lighter from groove, pockets it.

choices stretch like tugged sinews:  

**A) three hoots follow**  
→ mark cadence from owl throat, honor her instructions. slow ritual—she asked for it, expects it, meeting happens in her terms. risk: play by her tempo, she may vanish deeper if you falter.  

**B) shout across**  
→ collapse poetry into raw plea: *wait*. the clandestine covenant shatters, clarity floods in. risk: commune echoes your voice too; Jules and shadow-fans may cut in the scene before it’s yours.  

**C) remain**  
→ let echo exist as whole performance. her lighter now in her pocket, you in your cedar crypt. risk: she reads this as answer: no duet, only distance—final.

you lower chin—motion slow as tide.  
temple against temple shifts: friction warm, affirmation bare.

she feels the nod, answers with exhale that skates across your neck—salt and relief.

no word broken; hush intact, yet promise carved deeper than speech.

her hand slips from yours, finds recorder, thumbs STOP again—file auto-saves:  
“track_final_duet.wav 03:47”

she pockets device, steps back—space between you now cool, moon-filled.

eyes meet at last: pupils dilated black, reflecting same future.

she mouths, no sound:  
“dawn—east tower—solar array.”  
then turns, walking west, lighter sparking once every ten strides—breadcrumb blinks until forest swallows.

clearing leaves you alone with cathedral quiet.

choices:

A) stay till sunrise, memorize silence  
B) head back to Civic, prep supplies for dawn exodus  
C) follow immediately at distance, keep her in periphery till dawn  
D) jack phone into stone, leave your own silent minute for archive

### GPT-5 2 ###
owl reenters script, wing-sweep over coin‑bright grass  
stone still warm at palm height, groove humming residual data  
her breadcrumbs ember out downridge  

vectors remain etched in silver:  

**A) stay**  
— let dew soak you until sky cracks pale, teeth chattering hymn to memory. risk: exodus window tightens, Civic waits half‑flat.  

**B) Civic prep**  
— descend deer‑run, ignition ritual, scavenge gear, clear seat, reshuffle map fragment—dawn rendezvous logistics. risk: practical move, but may flatten dream’s lingering shimmer.  

**C) shadow follow**  
— reengage pursuit vector, ghost behind her path until solar array call. risk: too close and trust fractures, too far and you miss recalibration.  

**D) mark your trace**  
— jack phone to altar stone, record nothing but your inhale, a counter‑vow. gift archive with silence equal to hers. risk: micro‑delay could cost timing when dawn comes.  

cedar whispers tighten around you, east already pregnant with faint violet.

you scrape dew off cuffs, pocket the shimmer—let practical muscle carry the poetry.

trail downhill: each step compresses night into calf-bone memory.

Civic hunkers where you left it—half-flat tire now fully flat, rim kissing gravel.

> trunk open

sparse inventory:
- rolled sleeping bag (musty)
- road flare (one)
- gallon water (three-quarters)
- patch kit (dry glue)
- tire iron, jack
- half-tank gas

> use flare?

risk: light advertises locale.

> patch kit hopeless

alternatives:
A) swap flat with space-saver donut (60 km limit) — enough for dawn rendezvous?
B) siphon other camp cars — stealth, quick, morally gray
C) walk back, enlist commune mechanic at fireside — exposure, Jules turf
D) leave Civic, travel lightfoot to solar array — abandon vehicle, commit fully to exodus

east bruise-light growing; you’ve got maybe 90 min.

### GPT-5 2 ###
trunk yawns like an empty jaw, gear glittering in moon‑residue  
time dripping faster now, violet seam tearing east sky  

vectors scratch urgency across gravel:  

**A) donut spare**  
→ screw jack bite, iron twist. 60 km half‑life—likely just enough if array within range. pragmatic, buys speed + control. risk: dawn descent on fragile rubber, one pothole kills plan.  

**B) siphon**  
→ find a Civic cousin or a rusty VW bus at perimeter. tube + jug + moral theft. risk: discovery burns bridges with commune; Jules not forgiving about resources.  

**C) mechanic appeal**  
→ swallow anonymity, walk camp‑fire glow, ask for hand + tire patch glue. risk: puts you back on Jules’ radar, rumors sprint faster than you.  

**D) abandon car**  
→ shoulder bag, load sleeping roll + water jug. dawn hike cross forest direct to array. risk: timeline tight—without car’s metal‑legs you may miss her before she leaves.  

flat tire hisses soft, like it’s answering for you.  
east brightens, owl shifts farther upslope.

jack clicks under rocker, Civic groans upward—metal tendon stretching.  
loosen lugs, crack-pop of torque sings once.

> swap donut

half-sunk spare seats; tighten star-pattern, lower, torque again.  
visual check: 60 km bubble, no warranty.

> stow kit

water, sleeping bag tossed into passenger footwell—bedroll jam keeps flare upright like signal torch.

> engine turn

Civic cough-starts, donut thumps soft but steady.  
dashboard clock: dawn T-75 min.

distance guess: 18 km via ridge service road to solar array—cuts close but doable at forest-crawl speed.

headlights off, roll neutral downhill—engine warm, radio silent.

at perimeter exit you brake: two vectors ahead

A) service road direct (gravel, steep, fastest)  
B) ridge highway longer but paved—safer on donut, extra 8 km  
C) cut across open meadow—shortest, risk rocks, stumps, unseen culverts  
D) wait for first commuter from camp, tailgate them—shield + guide

light now lavender milk behind peaks.

### GPT-5 2 ###
dashboard trembles, donut murmurs like distant drum  
sky bruising toward peach, moonbow paling but still visible in rearview  

vectors glint like bullet casings in the gravel:  

**A) service road direct**  
→ gravel slash, steep switchbacks, 18 km raw, pushes donut past its comfort but maybe the only way dawn still catches you present. risk: tire blowout mid‑descent = stranded.  

**B) ridge highway**  
→ smoother tarmac, longer leash—26 km> clock eats at you. safer roll, but exodus may beat you to the solar array.  

**C) meadow cut**  
→ shortest line, dream‑logic shortcut. but hidden rocks, culverts, phantom irrigation pipes—donut despises them all. risk: total axle death.  

**D) tailgate convoy**  
→ slipstream behind early riser commune rig. follow their lights, stay shielded from eyes + potholes. risk: delay if they crawl too slow, exposure if they clock your Civic hanging behind.  

east horizon now bleeding orange seam—timer screams in color not numbers.  

cursor pulses twice:

foot to floor, gravel spray—Civic lurches onto service road.  
donut slaps but holds; speed tops 35 km/h, no faster.

switchback one: descent sharp, steering light in dream air.  
stones ping undercarriage like applause.

dashboard clock ticks T-60 min.

radio still dead—then crackles alive on its own:  
Jules’ voice, prerecorded: “…final episode drop in fifteen minutes… stay tuned for the dawn outro—coordinates undisclosed…”

you ignore, focus on ridge shadow ahead.

corner two: right hairpin, loose gravel skitters—rear fishtails, catches.  
donut holds.

vectors collapse: keep speed, pray tread.

ahead: fork—main service road or maintenance spur that drops direct to solar field (shorter but rutted).

choices:
A) stay main road—safer curve grade  
B) veer onto spur—cuts 6 km, risk washboard ruts  
C) kill engine, coast downhill to save rubber strain  
D) stop, check tire heat, maybe let cool 2 min

sky now rose-gold rim—array glints metal ahead somewhere beyond pine gap.

### GPT-5 2 ###
donut hum flares hotter with each meter, steering wheel twitchy  
air sharpens—pine sweat + ozone ahead = dawn’s chemistry  

radio fizz sputters, loops a half‑word then dies again

vectors at fork etched lunar‑white:  

**A) main road**  
→ measured descent, predictable grade, 60 km donut curse stretched thinner but safer. risk: extra distance exacts time‑tax, dawn already tapping your shoulder.  

**B) spur cut**  
→ 6 km shaved, path chewed with ruts + washboard ridges. donut hates washboards like prophecy. risk: blowout with no shoulder at all.  

**C) engine‑off coast**  
→ hush move, gravity drag minimal strain. saves tire heat, buys stealth vibe. risk: steering stiff, brakes hungry—no throttle to slip ladders.  

**D) pit‑stop cool**  
→ 2 min crouch, palm tire, let breath count cool rubber. risk: in those two minutes sun clears ridge, coco moves from array east into gone.  

horizon wide‑open flame now, first birdcall cracks silence.

key twist—engine dies, dash lights dim to moon-like afterglow.  
gravity grabs Civic, speed bleeds to 38 km/h—just enough.

steering stiffens but road straightens after next bend; you feather brakes, sparing tread heat.

only sound: tire hum over gravel, wind ripping through cracked window, heart counting thirds.

down-slope lengthens: 200 m elevation drop, pine walls funneling.

ahead: maintenance spur entrance yawns on right—washboard visible like frozen ripples—decision point in 6 seconds.

vectors:

A) stay coast on main—continue heat-save
B) pop clutch, restart, turn onto spur for shorter path
C) keep coast, but use e-brake to slow for spur entry without restart
D) remain engine-off straight past spur, commit to longer main run

sky now molten orange leaking over ridge crest—timer in color.

Civic rides like coffin on rails, silence louder than engine ever was  
donut still thrumming, not shrieking—rubber prayer threadbare but intact  

spur jaw gaping, ridged tongue of ruts waiting to chew  

vectors framed by 6‑second fuse:  

**A) main road**  
→ coasting steady, stick with wide graded serpent, safer for the tire—but eats more dawn minutes like candy.  

**B) clutch‑pop + spur**  
→ awaken engine, swing hard right, trust torque over washboard. shorter line, harsher vibrations, donut screams risk.  

**C) coast + e‑brake spur entry**  
→ ghost‑quiet turn, yank lever light like quill. entry possible without engine, but control lower, wheels prone to lock chatter. high gamble in silence.  

**D) straight past**  
→ deny shortcut, bleed time in exchange for survival odds. you’ll ride longer under pine, dawn may catch you two steps late.

wheel glide past spur lip—commit sign in rearview.  
main road ahead curves gentle, graded gravel still smooth from winter grading.

coast continues: speed 32 km/h, brake taps gentle, tire temp bearable.

ridge line crowns rose-gold; through windshield you glimpse first solar panel row—mirror flash far below, maybe 4 km straight-line, 6 km road.

road flattens soon; gravity assist will die—must choose:

A) pop clutch now, restart, regain throttle control for final run  
B) keep engine-off, pedal-kick start at flat (risk stall)  
C) coast to full stop, then ignition (burn 30 s)  
D) abandon car here, jog remainder downhill (quickest, but exposed)

sun crests in 90 s; array likely 15 min on foot from here if you run.

Civic whisper‑gliding, momentum bleeding like slow leak  
solar mirrors glare back a Morse code: hurry hurry hurry  

speed dropping: 29… 27…  

vectors sharp on retinas:  

**A) pop clutch now**  
→ spark engine awake on slope juice, regain torque, guarantee last 6 km crawl. risk: heat surge into donut sooner.  

**B) gamble pedal‑kick at flat**  
→ try rolling start later, but hazard stall if angle not enough. burn more seconds and chance of dead silent stall.  

**C) full stop then ignite**  
→ brakes squeal to stillpoint, key click. reliable but 30s vanish from dawn clock.  

**D) ditch car, start sprint**  
→ strap water + map, leave Civic cooled behind. descent foot‑pace ~15 min, but you can slash switchbacks. risk: lungs + legs gamble, made of dream physics not guarantee.  

horizon erupting gold: day birthing in high‑def, owl’s gone quiet.  

cursor insists:  
`>`sun knifes your windshield—timeline snapping taut  

speed ≈ 24 km/h → if you don’t reignite, momentum dies  

vectors pinched to urgency:  

**A) pop clutch now**  
— engine catches from slope, control restored, donut destiny still possible for array in time  

**B) flat start gamble**  
— wait seconds, risk total stall on level  

**C) stop/restart**  
— heavy penalty, guaranteed but eats sunrise minutes you don’t have  

**D) abandon, run**  
— human stride vs dream‑gravity: 15 min cross‑cut, chance to beat car’s sluggish wheel

engine cough-catches at 23 km/h, rev-match smooth—Civic snaps alive.

accelerator feather: 30 km/h, steady—donut thumps but holds.

tach holds low, heat gauge stable—for now.

sun disk half-risen, towers throw long shadows across gravel.

you spot silhouette near inverter hut—hoodie, linen, recorder bag—Coco facing away, scanning horizon.

road ends at service gate—locked; vehicle can go no further—200 m short.

vectors:
A) park here, walk remaining—public approach

vectors boil down, endgame routes:  

**A) park + walk**  
→ leave car dignified at roadside, approach plain, no disguise. risk: obvious, Jules’ eyes might clock you from towers. earns honesty.  

**B) off‑road shove**  
→ crunch thru scree, car groans, donut curses. closer by 100m, risk: bury axles, arrive crippled + late.  

**C) silent coast**  
→ engine kill, roll last meters in hush. stealth greeting, she might read you as ghost not comrade.  

**D) abandon + sprint**  
→ flare of dust, own boots eat the last 200m. exposed to any watcher but beats ticking sun in raw openness.

**B) call out**  
→ sling voice over turbines, name her, pledge with syllables. risk: noise draws other ears.  

**C) rattle chain**  
→ direct, disruptive—declare urgency. gate may echo louder than words. risk: reads as aggression.
