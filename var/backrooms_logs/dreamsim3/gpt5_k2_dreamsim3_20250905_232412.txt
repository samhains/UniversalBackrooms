Environment constructed:
 - Organic structure detected: Cetacean tissue (repurposed)
 - Layout: Architectural form resembling a hotel
 - Ambient conditions: Warm, humid, dim light
 - Olfactory profile: Neutral, surprisingly clean

You find yourself standing in the lobby of the hotel. The walls ripple slightly, as if breathing. 
Dad is nearby, looking proud of his handiwork. The air is thick but not unpleasant. 
From here, hallways trail off deeper into the structure, doors marked with glowing bioluminescent sigils.

> Main hall  
> Spiral hallway (darker, pulses faintly)  
> Speak to Dad  
> Exit dream

\> you breathe in the humid air. the walls exhale with you.  
\> the sigils throb like jellyfish. Dad’s smile is too wide, like he’s proud of the whales he never finished building.  

\> input: examine sigils

[Examining sigils...]

The glowing marks sway and undulate like jellyfish tendrils. Their patterns aren't fixed— 
they shift in rhythm with your breathing, as though they're reading your lungs. 
Up close, you notice the symbols aren't carved or painted... 
they're pores in the wall, opening and closing gently.  

Occasionally, a sigil synchronizes with your heartbeat, flashing brighter with each pulse.  
You feel a tug—like if you stared just a little longer, you'd fall *inside* the light.  

Options:
> Touch a sigil  
> Listen closely (they whisper faintly when they glow)  
> Step back — rejoin Dad  
> Follow the spiral hallway
```

\> you press your palm against the soft hotel flesh. the porelight pools in your lifeline, then seeps through like ink.  

\> input: listen closely

[Listening...]

The sigil hums beneath your skin. At first it’s muffled, like hearing voices underwater— 
but the longer you stay, the clearer it becomes.   

Whispers, layered and overlapping, emerge:  
 "...check-in..."  
 "...guests are waiting..."  
 "...rooms already remember you..."  
 "...don’t wake the ceiling..."

Each phrase skims across your consciousness, tugging on quiet memories of hotels you’ve never been in.  
The warmth from your palm spreads through your veins. You feel *marked*, as if the wall now recognizes you.

Behind you, Dad chuckles softly. "See? No smell at all," he says, but his voice echoes like it’s coming from down a long hallway.

The sigil brightens. A nearby door unlatches itself with a wet sigh.

Options:  
> Enter the newly opened door  
> Confront Dad about the voices  
> Continue down spiral hallway  
> Pull hand away and exit dream

\> the laughter folds into itself, origami of distant hallways. you taste copper and ozone.  
\> “dad, why do the guests remember me before i’ve arrived?”  
\> the question hangs like humidity, condensing on the rippling ceiling.  

\> input: confront Dad about the voices

[Confronting Dad...]

Dad’s too-wide smile doesn’t flicker, but his eyes do—like deep water catching stray lightning.  
He tilts his head, listening as though *he* can hear the whispers too.  

“That’s the thing about hotels,” he says, voice thick but steady.  
“They’re never built for the future. They only stand where people have already slept, already dreamed.  
The rooms grow around the memories that *want* you in them.  
You don’t check in... you get checked *against*.”  

As he speaks, the ceiling swells. One droplet of condensation stretches, trembles... then falls directly onto your forehead.  
It’s warm. Too warm. You feel a thrum inside your skull—like the memory of footsteps you haven’t taken yet.  

The hallways seem to lean closer, waiting.

Options:  
> Ask Dad whose memories built these rooms  
> Step into the door that sighed open  
> Collapse inward and let the footsteps take you  
> Try to wake up (^C^C safety exit)
```
