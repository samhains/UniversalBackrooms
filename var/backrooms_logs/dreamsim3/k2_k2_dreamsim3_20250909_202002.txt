simulator@moonshotai:~/$ ./dreamsim.exe "I go out to lunch with Qualiatik and her mum is there who is super friendly. She immediately asks a question about Tara which presumably diffuses the sense that I would be meeting with her like a “meet the parents” kind of date. All these other people are there, annoying kids, maybe those who were making the scroll with us before. I’m a bit embarrassed, but we are all squished into the same table. Everyone seems to get along.We get lost trying to find the store to return it. At the same time I become worried about driving home, the conditions can change at any moment and make it unsafe to drive home. We are looking for hotel as it’s been a long journey , but we can’t find it anymore . We go up and down the levels. I ask Tara if she can remember the brand name of the dress and she can’t ."

 0.00   you are standing on a sun-bleached sidewalk outside a pastel vegan café  
        named “Qualia”.  a string of brass wind-chimes tinkles like glitching PCM.  
        Inside, through the plate glass, you see Qualiatik waving vigorously,  
        her mum already halfway out of her chair to hug you.

 0.10   the door sighs open; compressed habanero air kisses your face.  
        Mum: “You must be the one who knows Tara!  She told us the funniest thing—  
        something about a dress label dissolving in a pool of static?”  
        The kids from the scroll workshop are jammed six-to-a-bench, arguing over  
        who gets the crayon shaped like a tiny RAM stick.  A toddler keeps pressing  
        the RESET button on your shin.

 0.18   Qualiatik slides you into the booth; her mum taps the menu:  
        “The return-policy noodles are compulsory—eat now, refund later.”  
        Everyone laughs like it’s an inside joke you’ll understand soon.

 0.22   objective overlay blinks:  
        ☐ find store to return “it” (item未定)  
        ☐ locate hotel before weather rollover  
        ☐ extract dress brand from Tara’s memory

 0.25   you ask Tara (across the table, flickering slightly) what brand the dress was.  
        She opens her mouth; the syllables fall out as origami cranes that unfold  
        into blank coupons.  Mum catches one, shrugs: “Generic dream-label, happens  
        every season.”

 0.31   waiter drops the check—it's a boarding pass printed on thermal paper:  
        GATE 404, DEPARTURE “SOONISH”.  Reverse side: a map of the mall levels,  
        but the escalators keep rearranging like a sliding puzzle.

 0.37   group consensus: pay, leave, find returns desk before the weather patch  
        downgrades traction to “slippery anecdote”.  Outside the window you notice  
        the sky has installer-bar gradient—77 %, but the percentage leaks off  
        like wet paint onto the street.

 0.42   everyone piles into the revolving door; kids stick chewing gum to the  
        sensors so it spins extra revolutions, dumping you out on Level B-2  
        instead of the street.  Fluorescent hum, shuttered kiosks, smell of  
        ozone and waffle cones.

 0.48   sign ahead: “RETURNS & REFUNDS / HOTEL CHECK-IN / MEMORY RECLAMATION”.  
        Arrow spins—points left, then right, then folds into itself like a  
        cheap lawn chair.  You lead the caravan anyway.

 0.55   corridor forks:  
        └─ west: motion-sensor lights flick on in sequence, revealing endless  
                 racks of dresses with labels written in disappearing ink  
        └─ east: a glass elevator promising “LOBBY / PARKING / EXIT TO WAKING”

 0.57   Tara tugs your sleeve: “I think the brand started with ‘∆’, or maybe  
        it was the sound of a zipper.  Can we write it in the air and see  
        if the mall remembers?”

 0.60   choose:  
        1) head west, let the dresses whisper their brands until one sticks  
        2) take the elevator, try to outrun the weather patch  
        3) stop, ask the kids to re-assemble the scroll—maybe the dress name  
           is archived in crayon metadata
