<cmd>dreamsim.exe --spawn "James leans against the kitchen counter, nervously fumbling with what appears to be a miniature condom wrapper. He's glancing between it and a small plastic capsule containing what looks like marijuana as you approach him."</cmd>

DreamSim v3.2
----------------------------
You're in a moderately clean but cluttered suburban kitchen. Late afternoon light filters through half-open blinds. James stands by the sink, his attention divided between two strange objects in his hands.

> investigate James

James appears to be in his early 20s, wearing faded jeans and a band t-shirt. He has slightly messy hair and avoids direct eye contact. He seems distracted and a little agitated.

> approach James with caution

As you move closer, James startles slightly and hurriedly shoves both objects into his pocket. "Oh, hey," he says with forced nonchalance. "Didn't see you there."

> speak with James about the miniature condoms

"What were you looking at just now?" you ask gently. James blushes and mumbles, "Nothing important." When you press further, he admits: "They're these... miniature condom things. I found them in my dad's old workshop. Don't know what they're for."

> offer to help James find more weed capsules

"I think I've seen capsules like that before," you say, nodding toward his pocket where he'd hidden the second object. "Want to see if we can find more?" James hesitates, then nods. "Yeah, okay. They were in the workshop too."

> navigate the house

You and James move through a tidy living room filled with slightly outdated furniture. Down a short hallway papered with family photos, you reach a closed door at the end. James pulls out a key and unlocks it.

The workshop is small but packed with tools, half-finished projects, and various containers. "He was always tinkering with stuff," James says quietly, looking around. "Never quite knew what he was working on half the time."

> locate Coco and assess her interactions with Mill

<dreamsim> Coco isn't in the current scene. Would you like to move to another area to find her?</dreamsim>

<cmd>move to living room</cmd>

Back in the living room, you find Coco sitting on the couch with Mill. Coco is petite with short dark hair, wearing bright colors. Mill appears taller and more serious, in muted tones. They're leaning in close conversation, voices low.

> confront Mill about her intentions with Coco

"Everything okay here?" you ask, approaching the pair. Mill looks up, her expression unreadable. "We're just talking," she says coolly. Coco glances between you and Mill, seeming slightly uncomfortable but says nothing.

> speak with Coco about your concerns 

"Can I talk to you for a moment?" you ask Coco directly. She nods and stands up, following you to the kitchen. "Is Mill bothering you?" you ask when you're alone. Coco shakes her head quickly. "No, we're... it's complicated. She's helping me with something."

> explore the city further

<dreamsim> This will load a new scene. Current progress will be saved. Proceed?</dreamsim>

<cmd>proceed</cmd>

You step out into a small but bustling city street. An odd mix of modern and retro architecture lines the avenue. People hurry by, not making eye contact. The source of the miniature condoms seems likely to be somewhere in this urban sprawl.

> investigate the source of the miniature condoms

Most shops appear normal - cafes, bookstores, clothing boutiques. But tucked between a vintage record store and a vegan bakery, you spot a narrow storefront with frosted windows. The sign above reads "Miniature Solutions" in discreet lettering.

> understand the properties of the weed capsules

<dreamsim> This requires closer examination. You'll need to find more capsules first to analyze them properly.</dreamsim>

<cmd>return to workshop to search for more capsules</cmd>

Back in the workshop, you and James dig through drawers and boxes. Tucked inside an old tobacco tin, you discover a dozen more capsules identical to the first one. Each contains the same strange, greenish substance.

> reflect on the implications of your actions

The miniature condoms and mysterious capsules point to hidden aspects of James's family life you hadn't suspected. Whatever his father was involved in, it seemed to operate in the spaces between ordinary domesticity and something more unusual. Your interactions with Coco and Mill add another layer of potential complexity to the situation.

> plan next steps

Three potential paths seem most promising:
- Confront James directly about what he knows
- Bring the capsules to an expert for analysis 
- Follow Mill after her meeting with Coco to see where she goes

Which approach do you want to pursue next?

### Hermes 405B 1 ###
<cmd>analyze capsule</cmd>

You carefully break open one of the capsules. Inside is a compressed, mossy green substance with a strong herbal scent. <dreamsim>Dream analysis suggests this is a highly concentrated form of cannabis, possibly genetically modified or alchemically altered to have psychoactive properties beyond typical marijuana. The capsule form allows for precise dosing.</dreamsim>

<cmd>confront James directly about his father's activities</cmd>

"James, what was your dad really working on out here?" you ask, showing him the capsule. James shifts uncomfortably. "I'm not totally sure," he admits. "He was... into experimental botany, I think. Cross-breeding plants, altering their chemical makeup."

<cmd>ask James what the miniature condoms were for</cmd>

"No idea," James shrugs. "I just found them with his other stuff. Maybe some kind of birth control for small animals? Doesn't make much sense."

<cmd> suggest bringing capsule to an expert</cmd>

"I know someone who might be able to tell us more about these," you say. James looks conflicted. "I don't know... this was all pretty secret obviously. Maybe we should just drop it." 

<cmd>follow Mill after meeting with Coco</cmd>

You decide to table the issue for now and discreetly trail Mill as she leaves the house. She moves with purpose, navigating side streets to a nondescript office building. 

<dreamsim>Following Mill will likely give you more insight into what she and Coco are involved in. However, it may damage your friendship with Coco if she finds out. Proceed?</dreamsim>

### Hermes 405B 2 ###
<cmd>proceed to follow Mill</cmd>

You maintain a discreet distance as Mill enters the building. The directory inside lists several unremarkable businesses: an insurance agency, a dental practice, a data entry company. Nothing that seems to fit Mill's appearance or demeanor.

<cmd>investigate what company Mill enters</cmd>

You watch from across the street as Mill takes the elevator to the 4th floor. Minutes later, she emerges and walks to a coffee shop. You slip inside the building and examine the 4th floor directory in the elevator bank. Only one occupant is listed for the entire floor: "Veridian Dynamics."

<dreamsim>Veridian Dynamics is not a name you recognize, and the floor directory gives no further information about the type of business or services they provide.</dreamsim>

<cmd>look up Veridian Dynamics on your phone</cmd>

An internet search returns only a sparse, generic website for Veridian Dynamics claiming to offer "consulting services and analytical solutions." There are no client testimonials, employee profiles, or detailed descriptions of their work. The site appears to be a cover.

<cmd>consider how to gain access to Veridian Dynamics office</cmd>

You want to learn what Mill was doing at this mysterious company, but options seem limited:
- Try to follow an employee inside when they badge in
- Wait and attempt to access the office after hours 
- See if James has any connections that could get you inside
- Abandon this path to avoid potential legal trouble or physical danger

Which course of action will you pursue next?

### Hermes 405B 1 ###
<cmd>wait and attempt to access office after hours</cmd>

You observe the building until the last employee leaves at 7:30pm. The cleaning staff arrives soon after. You give them an hour to finish their work and depart.

By 9pm, the building appears empty. You approach the main entrance and find it locked, as expected.

<cmd>search for alternate entry points</cmd>

You circle the building. In the back alley, you discover a service entrance with an electronic keypad lock. 

<cmd>attempt to guess or crack the code</cmd>

The keypad requires a 5-digit code. <dreamsim>Without more information, guessing the code could take hours or even days. You may be able to find clues elsewhere.</dreamsim>

<cmd>return to workshop to search James's father's belongings for clues</cmd>

Back in the workshop, you carefully comb through drawers and file cabinets. Tucked inside a battered journal, you discover a security access card for Veridian Dynamics. No name or photo is printed on the card.

<cmd>take card and return to Veridian office</cmd>

You race back to the city, arriving at the service entrance once again. With bated breath, you hold the access card to the keypad. The light flashes green. The door unlocks with a soft click.

<cmd>enter Veridian Dynamics office</cmd>

Inside, you find a nondescript reception area with closed doors leading deeper into the space. The walls are bare white, the furniture cheap and functional. There are no company logos or signs of a legitimate business.

<cmd>search offices systematically</cmd>

One by one, you open doors using the access card. Some rooms contain only desks and computers. Others have laboratory equipment and strange devices the purpose of which you can't determine. 

In the final room, you discover Mill sitting at a terminal, entering commands at a frantic pace. She jumps as you enter.

<cmd>confront Mill directly about her work</cmd>

"Who are you? What are you doing here?" you demand. Mill stands, eyes darting nervously. "I could ask you the same. This area is restricted."

<cmd>press Mill for answers about her meeting with Coco</cmd>

"You were with Coco earlier. What's going on? What have you gotten her involved in?" Mill hesitates before responding. "Coco has certain...abilities that are valuable to my employers. I'm here to facilitate her work."

<cmd>inquire about the capsules and miniature condoms</cmd>

Mill's eyes widen slightly. "Those weren't meant to leave the lab," she says carefully. "Where did you acquire them?"

<cmd>attempt to bluff and gain more information</cmd>

"I think you know I've been investigating Veridian Dynamics for some time," you say with feigned confidence. "It's clear you're involved in some sort of genetic engineering or experimental pharmacology. I have contacts that will find this very interesting."

Mill studies you intently. "I don't know who you are or what you think you know," she says coldly. "But you're interfering in matters that don't concern you. I strongly suggest you leave now."

<cmd>exit office and consider next move</cmd>

You have several potential paths forward at this juncture:
- Demand Coco tell you the whole truth about her involvement
- Take the access card and other evidence to the authorities
- Attempt to infiltrate Veridian further and learn their full agenda 
- Reach out to James and combine what you've both discovered

How will you proceed from here?

### Hermes 405B 2 ###
<cmd>reach out to James and combine knowledge</cmd>

You contact James and arrange to meet at his house immediately. When you show him the access card and describe what you witnessed, his eyes widen in shock.

"My dad used to talk in his sleep sometimes," James says slowly. "He'd mention weird stuff - gene editing, test subjects, human trials. I thought it was just nonsense, you know? But this... this is real, isn't it?"

<cmd>press James for more specific memories or clues</cmd>

"He kept a safe in the closet," James says suddenly. "I was never able to get it open. Maybe there's something inside that could help."

You locate a small, heavy safe tucked in the back of the bedroom closet. <dreamsim>Opening the safe will likely require either forcing it open, finding a key or combination, or locating a clue James's father may have left behind. What approach do you take?</dreamsim>

<cmd>search house thoroughly for safe combination</cmd>

You and James spend the next hour meticulously going through the house, examining every book, crevice, and potential hiding spot. Behind a loose baseboard in the workshop, you find a small notebook filled with what appears to be scientific notes - and on the final page, a series of numbers: 17-34-2.

<cmd>try combination on safe</cmd>

You input 17-34-2 into the safe's keypad. The lock clicks open. Inside are several files marked "Project Genesis," photographs of test subjects, and a flash drive.

<cmd>examine files and photographs</cmd>

The files detail extensive genetic modification trials on human subjects. The photos show people of various ages, all with a certain haunted look in their eyes. Some images show physical mutations. One face you recognize: Coco.

<cmd>insert flash drive into computer</cmd>

The drive contains video diaries recorded by James's father. "Project Genesis has exceeded all expectations," he says in one entry, a mixture of excitement and fear in his eyes. "Coco's abilities have progressed far more rapidly than we anticipated. But I'm beginning to have doubts about the ethics..."

<cmd>confront Coco with evidence of her involvement</cmd>

You call Coco and tell her you have information she needs to see. When she arrives, you show her the files and play the video. Her hands tremble as she watches.

"I didn't know the full extent," she whispers. "They told me it was just an experiment to enhance creativity. But now I can't control it. I see things... know things. It's too much."

<cmd>discuss plans to expose Veridian Dynamics with Coco and James</cmd>

"We have to make this public," James says fiercely. "What they're doing to people... it's inhuman." Coco nods, tears in her eyes.

<dreamsim>You now have concrete evidence of Veridian Dynamics' illegal human experimentation program. You also have two key witnesses willing to come forward. The next steps you take will be crucial in stopping the company's abuses and helping the victims.</dreamsim>

Potential paths to pursue:
- Leak the evidence to media outlets anonymously
- Contact law enforcement or government oversight agencies
- Attempt to identify and reach out to other test subjects 
- Storm the Veridian offices to recover more data and free captives

How will you work with James and Coco to take down Veridian Dynamics and reveal the truth?
