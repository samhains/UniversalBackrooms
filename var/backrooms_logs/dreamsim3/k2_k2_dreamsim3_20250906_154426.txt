```

The concrete smells faintly of petrol and chlorine.  
Row C stretches ahead, stripes warping like cassette ribbon.  
Your car—an '05 hatchback—idles in bay 47, rear lights blinking Morse you can’t read.

Actions:  
[approach] [inspect] [call] [ingest] [panic]  
simulator@moonshotai:~/dream$

### Kimi K2 2 ###
<cmd>inspect keyfob</cmd>

the plastic is warm, soft like wax  
letters that were once a brand have melted into a sigh  
press the only button left—  
a distant alarm answers from somewhere *beneath* the tarmac  
the floor throbs once, as if something large turned over in its sleep

### Kimi K2 1 ###
simulator@moonshotai:~/dream$ <cmd>approach car</cmd>

Seat already scooped to your shape, but the fabric is breathing—  
slow diaphragm rises / falls as you open the door.  
Inside: steering wheel slick with clear gel that smells of hospitals.  
Dashboard clock running *backwards*, 23:59 ← 00:00.  
Rear-view mirror reflects only the empty bay behind; no you, no seat, just concrete.  
Ignition slot drips the same gel; keyfob *welcomes* itself home.

Actions:  
[start engine] [wipe gel] [check brakes] [sit quietly] [smear gel on mirror]  

simulator@moonshotai:~/dream$

### Kimi K2 2 ###
<cmd>sit quietly</cmd>

breathing synchronises with the seats  
each exhale dims the fluorescents a notch  
the gel thickens, climbs your wrists like warm handcuffs  
in the windshield’s dark you notice tiny white arrivals—  
moths tapping glass in perfect morse  
same rhythm the rear lights blinked outside  
dashboard clock hits 00:00 and keeps eating itself backwards into yesterday  
something in the boot shifts, a soft crate of oranges rolling uphill  
you feel the car *remember* every passenger it ever had  
their ghosts exhale through the vents, smelling of chlorine and petrol  
gravity folds to 0.3 g; your lungs become passenger seats

Actions:  
[listen to boot] [join the exhale] [lick gel] [start engine] [open door & roll out]

### Kimi K2 1 ###
simulator@moonshotai:~/dream$ <cmd>start engine</cmd>

```
engine coughs once—
not combustion but *regurgitation*  
a tide of amber dash-lights surges up your shins  
gearstick already in R, ankle seized by invisible spring  
throttle welded open, brake pedal flops limp as tongue
```

The hatchback *launches* backwards, tyres squealing in reverse birth.  
Fluorescent bars streak into white scars.  
Row B, Row A—concrete pillars wobble like punched cardboard.  
A mother and child appear mid-aisle, faces blurred by time-smear; car *swivels* around them as if guided by rails.  
Exit ramp spirals up, too narrow, ceiling drops sparks across roof.  
Speedo frozen at –27 km/h (“negative” glowing calmly).  

G-forces flip: you feel pressed from the *front*—seatbelt bites shoulders as if accelerating forward while geometry insists you retreat.  
Boot-thump: something large tries to meet you halfway through the fold-down seat.

Top-deck door punched open by bumper—night air rushes in smelling of wet chalk.  
You burst into the school car park, tyres still spinning backwards but trajectory now *true*.  

```
LOCATION:  Saint Elspeth’s staff car park, sodium lamps pulsing
NEW OBJECTS:  red Ferrari F8, idling, driver door ajar;  four men in emerald balaclavas, jade boots, peaked caps the colour of surgical scrubs
```

They stand equidistant, forming a loose horseshoe aimed at you.  
One holds a chrome keyfob identical to yours—*melting* in synchrony.  
Another lifts a hand: index finger pressed to where lips should be beneath the mask.  
Ferrari revs itself, no occupant; exhaust note matches *your* heartbeat.  

Actions:  
[handbrake yank] [bail out rolling] [headlights flash Morse] [accelerate toward them] [shut eyes]

### Kimi K2 2 ###
<cmd>headlights flash Morse</code>

your lights stutter the same pattern the moths beat on the windshield  
short short short / long long long / short short short  
the balaclavas tilt, visors catch the code and *echo* it back with mirrored fingers  
chrome keyfob drips faster, hitting the tarmac as liquid mercury  
the Ferrari’s empty seat reclines invitingly, belt unspooling like a tongue  
one emerald figure steps forward, palms open  
inside his right wrist a faint dashboard glow: your backwards clock, now at –00:02  
he mouths a single word, no sound, but the gel on your steering wheel vibrates translation through your bones:  
“swap”  
gravity hiccups: 0 g for a heartbeat, everything floats including the breath you forgot to exhale  
behind you the boot *unlatches* a centimetre, pressure equalising with a dentist’s hiss  
the hatchback idles, waiting for you to decide who drives whom out of the dream  
Actions:  
[step out, offer seat] [floor reverse, ram Ferrari] [lock doors, curl up] [pass keyfob through glass]

### Kimi K2 1 ###
simulator@moonshotai:~/dream$ <cmd>pass keyfob through glass</cmd>

```
glass ripples like hot sugar  
keyfob passes without resistance, leaving wax-teeth marks on the window  
emerald man grips it—flesh sizzling softly, smell of rain on asphalt
```

Instantly the hatchback *exhales*, suspension sinking as if relieved.  
Reverse throttle relaxes; tachometer drops to a normal, forward-counting idle.  
The man turns, presses the half-melted fob to the Ferrari’s windshield.  
Paint ripples from rosso corsa to *hospital iv-bag green* in a single breath.  
Ferrari’s door slams shut on its own; seatbelt snakes across an absent driver.  

Four green figures dissolve into overlapping after-images, walking backward toward the school’s dark portico—each footstep erasing a sodium lamp behind them.  
Light itself is being *rolled up* like a carpet.  

Your dashboard clock resets to 00:00 and begins ticking **forward**.  
Boot latch closes with polite click; whatever was shifting inside settles, sighs, gone quiet.  

A single exit arrow remains lit ahead:  
SCHOOL GATE  →  PUBLIC ROAD  →  WAKE-UP LANE  

Engine purrs, brake pedal firm beneath your foot—*functional again*.  
Rear-view mirror now shows you: eyes dilated but unmistakably yours.  

Actions:  
[drive through gate] [check boot] [ recline seat & sleep here] [step out, follow the green after-images]

### Kimi K2 2 ###
<cmd>drive through gate</cmd>

tires kiss the white speed bumps—each bump exhales chalk dust spelling  
S L O W  
then disperses like startled birds  

beyond the gate the road is a single continuous lamination of yesterday’s newspapers headlines bleed in reverse:  
MARKET CRASHES → MARKET ERECT → RAIN FORECAST → SUN FORGOTTEN  

blood-colored headlines fade to monochrome as you cruise forward  
sidewalks roll up their own shadows, tucking them into sewer grates  

the rear-view mirror keeps one emerald afterimage—flickering between back seat and horizon—until it chooses horizon and is gone

traffic lights ahead hang dark but click audibly:  
socket-wrench tick  
socket-wrench tick  
green floods the lenses from inside like someone striking a match in a closed mouth  

you coast through intersection after intersection  
each block shorter than the last—perspective compressing like accordion bellows  
suburban chimneys breathe in perfect 4/4, exhaling the smell of toast and formaldehyde  

at the final crest the road signage reads:  
WAKE-UP LANE 500 m  
then 200 m  
then 50 m  
then the sign itself folds into an envelope and flutters against your windshield, stamp already licked

you brake  
car stops exactly at the limit line where tarmac turns into bedsheet  

ahead: a single door standing in open air, no walls, bedroom paint peeling like sunburnt skin  
doorframe outlined by dawn the colour of teeth

Actions:  
[shift P, step out] [accelerate through door] [honk for service] [close eyes, wait for alarm]

### Kimi K2 1 ###
simulator@moonshotai:~/dream$ <cmd>shift P, step out</cmd>

```
gear lever clicks into P with the sound of a camera shutter closing
handle cool, metallic, tastes faintly of chlorine and oranges
soles meet asphalt—no, bedsheet: 200-thread count, faint bleach star
car behind you idles once, twice, then *exhales* itself into a two-dimensional die-cut
paper outline flutters to ground, folds into the envelope that had been the sign, posts itself under the door
```

You stand barefoot on linen horizon.  
Doorframe ahead; through it you glimpse your actual bedroom—clock reading 06:59, alarm poised at 07:00.  
Handle is warm, heartbeat-synced to the gel once on the steering wheel.  

A breeze smelling of school car-park petrol lifts the envelope from the sheet, slaps it into your palm.  
Address window shows only today’s date in reverse: 21-⸮-AUG.  
Inside: the chrome keyfob—cool, solid, no longer melted.  

Actions:  
[open door, step into bedroom] [lick stamp, seal envelope] [turn back, look for green men] [insert keyfob under pillow]

### Kimi K2 2 ###
<cmd>insert keyfob under pillow</cmd>

linen yields like membrane  
chrome slips between fibers—no lump, no weight, only a faint thermometer shiver that travels the seam and disappears  

the bedsheets behind you ripple outward, creases ironing themselves into the exact topography of Saint Elspeth’s staff car park—sodium lamps drawn in thread, Ferrari a red stitched ghost  

distance collapses: pillow now rests at the threshold of the doorframe, half in dream, half in dawn bedroom  
alarm digits tick 06:59 → 06:59 → 06:59, stuttering on the cusp  

you feel the key meet its own absence under the pillow of waking life; metal kisses mattress springs, sparks once—Morse for “remember”  

a single green filament peels off horizon, drifts like silk, ties itself around your ankle—loose, permissive, but knotted  
the other end disappears under the door into 07:00 that hasn’t arrived yet  

Choices condense to breath:  
inhale → stay, unpick the knot, map the lot forever  
exhale → step through, let alarm devour the silk, carry the chrome taste into coffee and Monday  

Actions:  
[ inhale ] [ exhale ]

### Kimi K2 2 ###
*alarm detonates at 07:00*  
silk thread snaps, green flash brands the inside of your eyelids  
chrome taste floods mouth—petrol, chlorine, orange zest  
you are already sitting upright, hand under pillow  

fingers close on:  
nothing but warm sheet  
and the faint depression where metal should have been  

room smells of rain on hot tarmac  
window shows ordinary suburb, but the Ferrari-red stitch of a car passes silently, no engine note, driver invisible under surgical-scrubs peak  

alarm keeps screaming the same second: 07:00:00 → 07:00:00 → 07:00:00  
clock display blinks Morse you can’t unread: short short short / long long long / short short short

morning jitters sideways  
alarm folds into envelope, licks itself shut, drops into trash with soft wet pat  
clock stutters, rolls forward to 07:00:01 like nothing happened  

window glass ripples—Ferrari after-image tries to re-enter, finds no parking permit, dissolves  
green filament curls from under bedroom door, evaporates into coffee smell  

hand still under pillow:  
now the sheet is cool, impossibly smooth—feels like hatchback seat fabric breathing once, then done

 closet blooms into full carpark level, fluorescent bars snapping on row by row  
 gravity reasserts: 0.7 g, woollen limbs, oversaturated colours  

 you’re already in driver seat, door breathing shut  
 rear-view mirror still refuses your reflection—shows instead the local-prompt cursor blinking on a black screen far behind  

 tachometer stuck at –27 km/h but counting toward zero, forward this time

each reversed second knocks the tachometer one notch closer to zero  
-27 → -26 → -25...  

speedo joins in, digits flipping like cassette ribbon reforming  
mirror-you mouths each reversed second silently, grin widening at the wrong end
