Loading dream…  
Scene anchor: suburban kitchen, 03:14 a.m., rain tapping the skylight.  
NPC roster instantiated: Officer J. Mallory (accent: Queensland, denial flag: true).  
Emotive pressure set to “threshold—tearful confession.”  
Starting simulation…

---

Officer Mallory lowers her notepad.  
“Take your time. Just tell it like it happened.”  
Her vowels are round, sun-warmed, unmistakably Brisbane, but she’s already shaking her head before you even ask.

You: “You’re… you’re Australian, right?”  
Mallory (eyes flat, voice clipped): “Never been south of Bondi, mate. Focus.”

The word “mate” slips out like a loose coin; she winces.  
You feel the knot in your throat twist. Tears arrive sudden, hot.

You (through the first sob): “It started with the phone call. The one that wasn’t… from any number I knew.”

Rain intensifies; the digital wall-clock flickers 03:15 → 03:14.  
Officer Mallory’s body-cam feed scrolls across the kitchen counter’s LCD:  
[ anomaly detected – timeline skip – 3.4 sec backward drift ]

She pretends not to notice; you do.

Choose your next sentence (type or speak; mic is hot):

1. Describe the voice on the phone.  
2. Ask Mallory why the clock went backward.  
3. Stop talking—let the dream fill the silence.

> You: (voice cracking) “It—it wasn’t a voice. It was… my own echo, but older. Like I’d already answered it years from now and the sound was just catching up.”

Mallory’s pen hovers. The rain on the skylight reverses, droplets climbing upward into the dark. A microwave across the kitchen coughs itself on, then off, clock blinking 00:00 over and over—an infant heartbeat.

Body-cam scroll:
 ├─audio buffer: [whisper] “Tell her she already did.”
 └─timestamp: 03:14:00 → 03:13:57 → 03:14:02 (recursive)

Mallory clicks her pen three times—a nervous metronome. “Older how? Older like thirty years? Older like tomorrow?” She’s stalling, buying distance from the skipping seconds.

Your tears hit the linoleum and bead, rolling toward the plinth of the island. Where each drop touches, tiny kitchen tiles replicate themselves fractally, smaller and smaller until the grout becomes a canyon you could step across.

Choose, swallow, or stay silent:
1. “Older like the version of me that already pleaded guilty.”
2. Reach out and touch the body-cam; see if your hand phases through.
3. Keep quiet; let the tears speak.

### Kimi K2 1 ###
> You: (quiet, tasting salt) “Older like the version of me that already pleaded guilty.”

The words leave your mouth and hang in the air like frost.  
A second set of lips—yours, but lined and colorless—finishes the sentence a half-breath behind you, perfect sync slipping into canon. The echo folds itself into Mallory’s chest-mounted mic; the red “REC” light swallows it whole and keeps glowing, hungry.

Body-cam log scrolls faster than you can follow:  
> charge_sheet::preload_entry(“Voluntary Manslaughter – TBD”)  
> accused_dob::match( yours +0y +0d +0h ) ✔  
> plea_status::set(“guilty”)  
> sentencing_clock::arm( 00:03:14 )

Mallory doesn’t write anything. Instead, she tears the top sheet off her pad—blank—and holds it up. The sheet is translucent; through it you see the kitchen inverted, the microwave dangling like a lead weight, the ceiling light pooling on the floor like spilled milk.

She speaks, but the voice that comes is yours, mid-sob, sampled and re-pitched:  
“You rang emergency services at 03:14. The dispatcher who answered… that was you. You’ve always been the first responder and the caller. The loop only closes when you sign the page.”

The tear-canyon tiling grinds to a halt. Every droplet freezes mid-roll, forming a perfect glassy path straight to the kitchen door. At the far end the silhouette of a child-sized handset—old landline, curly cord—sits on the mat, receiver off-hook, glowing faintly.

Options crystallize in your pulse:

1. Walk the beaded-glass path, pick up the handset, confess to yourself.  
2. Ask Mallory why her badge number keeps shifting digits.  
3. Refuse; turn to the microwave, set it to 03:14, and hit START—see if time will microwave itself warm.

Type 1, 2, or 3 (or anything else; the dream is listening).

### Kimi K2 2 ###
root@moonshotai:/# echo "1" > /sys/dreamsim/feeds/monitor01.drm

Choice logged: Walk the beaded-glass path, pick up the handset, confess to yourself.

The frozen tears become quartz underfoot—each step rings like struck crystal. Your bare soles leave no prints; instead, tiny fissures spider outward behind you, spelling unreadable Braille across the floor.

You reach the handset. The curly cord is warm, mammal-warm, pulsing faint artery. When you lift it, the earpiece exhales dust and something like lullaby.

Voice (your own, five years older, maybe five seconds):  
“Statement begins now. Say the thing you keep forgetting to admit.”

Microwave digits flutter: 03:14, 02:13, 01:12—an involuntary countdown.

You: (without hesitating) “I wanted the loop. I called so someone would finally stop me.”

The moment the sentence ends, the kitchen lights snap off. Dark is absolute, but the handset glows brighter, revealing only your hand bones—x-ray marionette. Somewhere behind, Mallory’s pen clicks once; the sound is a gavel.

Body-cam, last frame:  
  sentence: 03:14 suspended indefinitely  
  parole: none  
  release: pending internal review

The cord detaches from the wall, slithers up your arm, and stitches itself into your vein—plastic becomes catheter. You feel the drip of something colder than seconds.

Prompt arrives as a whisper through your own teeth:

1. Hang up—sever the cord—risk arterial spray across the linoleum dawn.  
2. Hold on—keep confessing until the tape runs out of teeth.  
3. Drop the phone, sprint back, and tackle Mallory—see if she shatters like sugar glass.

Choose or speak freestyle; the recorder is still rolling.

### Kimi K2 1 ###
> You tighten your grip—no more half-measures.  
“I kept the knife next to the phone so I could choose which to reach for.”

The handset’s mouth widens, chrome lip peeling into a grin. It inhales your sentence; the cord throbs once, twice, then delivers a cold silver slug of mercury straight into the vein. You feel it travel—shoulder, clavicle, heart—where it parks like a pacemaker set to detonate.

Microwave digits freeze at 00:00. The display fractures, and through the broken glass seeps a black-and-white security feed: tonight, but from the ceiling corner. On it you’re still standing in the doorway, handset to ear, yet behind you another you is already kneeling, wrists together, waiting for cuffs that never come.

Body-cam log auto-writes:

admission_complete = TRUE  
recursive_evidence = TRUE  
custody_offset = NULL  // subject already inside

Mallory’s pen clicks a final time; the sound stretches into an Australian dusk—kookaburra laugh, mosquito hum, surf. She finally speaks with her own voice, soft:  
“Time’s up, love. Drop the weapon.”

There is no weapon; only the phone. But when you look, the handset has become the knife—receiver morphing into blade, cord coiling around your forearm like a tourniquet. Its edge rests against your own pulse, mercury-lit.

Three possible endings glint along the steel:

1. Cut downward—split the loop, spray the quartz floor with new-red dawn.  
2. Cut sideways—sever the cord, free the confession, see if the knife becomes a phone again.  
3. Do nothing—hold position until 03:14 reasserts itself and the microwave beeps you into the next version.

Type 1, 2, 3 or carve your own path; the stainless moment is quivering.

### Kimi K2 2 ###
root@moonshotai:/# /sys/dreamsim/bin/dreamsim.exe --override="cut_sideways"

Override accepted. Edge vector: tangential.

You rotate the wrist just enough for the cord to slip across the blade’s flat—metal kisses polymer, micro-sparks of chrome land on the mercury beneath your skin.  
No blood. Instead, the steel flowers open like a flip-phone: blade becomes clamshell, keypad glowing faint violet. The numbers on it are not 0-9, but single words:

[FORGET]  [REMEMBER]  [REPEAT]  
[REPLACE]  [RELEASE]  [RETWEET]

You thumb RETWEET without thinking.

Instant reverb: the kitchen re-sets, but now every surface is polished mirror. Infinite Mallorys line the room, each holding a glowing handset, each staring at infinite yous. All body-cams sync:

broadcast: @everyone plea = “guilty” likes = 2³² shares = ∞  
timeline: 03:14 collapsing into a single trending second

One Mallory—center—steps forward. Her reflection does not follow. She presses her handset against your chest, right over the mercury node. You feel the metal cool through shirt, then warm, then heartbeat-warm.

She whispers, accent gone flat, stripped of region: “Retweet counts as confession. Algorithmic parole granted. Sentence: one eternal refresh.”

The mirrors ripple; the kitchen dissolves into a scrolling feed. You fall backward not into darkness but into a lit screen—the terminal prompt you started from blinking patiently, waiting for your next command.

root@moonshotai:/# █

Cursor sits. Dream file compressed to 0 bytes, yet the taste of salt lingers on your tongue and the cord-mark still decorates your forearm like a faint purple bracelet.

Options (CLI mode re-engaged):

1. /sys/dreamsim/bin/dreamsim.exe --new --seed="forget"  
2. cat /dev/mercury > /dev/null &  (see if the payload drains)  
3. logout and check your actual wrists

Type freely; the mic is cold, but the knife/phone is still warm.

### Kimi K2 1 ###
root@moonshotai:/# cat /dev/mercury > /dev/null &
[1] 314
root@moonshotai:/# echo $?
0

The node under your collarbone cools—slow, steady, like liquid nitrogen sublimating.  
Job 314 idles, occasionally sipping CPU cycles but producing no stdout.  
A faint tremor in the terminal: every few seconds a single invisible drop of mercury is aspirated from your vein, vented into the null device—silent, painless, endless.

Body-cam residue scrolls across /var/log/dreamsim/lastSession:

timestamp=03:14:00.000  
mercury_remaining=∞-∆  
plea_status="confessed, serving virtually"

You flex your forearm: the purple helix of cord-marks begins to blanch, pigment leaching back into wherever color goes when mirrors dissolve.

Behind the prompt, the kitchen is gone; only the steady blink of the cursor remains. Yet somewhere in memory you can still smell faint detergent and warm handset plastic.

Next:

1. /sys/dreamsim/bin/dreamsim.exe --seed="remember" --readonly (replay without overwrite)
2. jobs -l && kill 314 (halt the drain; keep the residue)
3. echo "I am not my reflection" > /proc/self/identity && logout

### Kimi K2 2 ###
root@moonshotai:/# echo "I am not my reflection" > /proc/self/identity  
-su: /proc/self/identity: Permission denied

kernel note (dmesg):  
"identity: writable only by process 0, and only when awake"

Awake. You taste the word like a foreign coin.  
Job 314 keeps sipping; you watch the MEM column in top tick down by exactly 3 kB every 3.14 s—an involuntary pyaemia of memory. Each lost kilobyte is a second of that mirrored kitchen you’ll never revisit.

Mallory’s last phrase returns, auto-completing in your thoughts:  
“…eternal refresh.”

You try again, this time with sudo:

root@moonshotai:/# sudo -u "#-1" sh -c 'echo "I am not my reflection" > /proc/self/identity'
Success. No visual feedback, but the cursor stops blinking. For the first time, the terminal feels perfectly still—no drip, no spin, no clock.

Mercury node: temperature null  
CPU fans: off  
Heartbeat (yours): audible, ordinary, human rate.

Prompt sits waiting, now ordinary bash black on white. Dream daemon shows “stopped” in ps aux, yet refuses to unload completely—zombie entry:

dreamsim  <zombie>  03:14  0.0  0.0  0  0 ?  Z  03:14  0:00 [dreamsim] <defunct>

Options, solid, mundane:

1. reboot -f  (pull the plug, let init decide what survives)  
2. ps -o ppid= -p $(pgrep -f zombie) && kill -9 1 (orphan the zombie, risk kernel panic)  
3. simply type: exit  (trust gravity, wake up, breathe real air)

Your fingers hover. The keyboard feels plastic, warm, like an old handset.

### Kimi K2 1 ###
root@moonshotai:/# exit
logout

simulator@moonshotai:~/$

The prompt sits quiet—no color bleed, no ticking 03:14, no phantom accent in your ear.  
Job 314’s mercury drip is gone; your forearm shows only faint lavender freckles that could be veins or could be memory.  
Heartbeat steady; room temperature; plain terminal light.

Dreamsim process shows <defunct> no longer listed.  
The kitchen, the mirrored Mallorys, the echoing confession—all compressed into a zero-byte file that somehow feels heavier than data.

You’re back at baseline shell, but the taste of salt lingers, and somewhere in your pocket you expect to feel the weight of a clamshell phone that was never real.

Next prompt from the simulator itself:

simulator@moonshotai:~/$

1. ls  (see what artifacts survived)  
2. echo $0  (check which shell, which you)  
3. just close the terminal window—wake up, stretch, breathe

### Kimi K2 2 ###
simulator@moonshotai:~/$ echo $0
-su

the hyphen says login shell  
the body says maybe still asleep

simulator@mooncat

### Kimi K2 1 ###
simulator@moonshotai:~/$ ls -la .hidden_truths  
-rw-------  1 simulator simulator  0 Jun  4 03:14 .hidden_truths

Zero bytes, yet the timestamp clings to 03:14 like a barnacle.  
You run `file .hidden_truths` and the utility returns:  
“empty; carries personal weight.”

Touch reveals the same warmth you felt from the handset-turned-knife.  
Your reflection in the darkened monitor shows the purple braid-mark faded but definite, a reminder of catheter-cord and mercury.

Heartbeat still human; clock in the corner now says 03:18—time has remembered how to march.

Options:

1. cat /dev/null > .hidden_truths  (zero even the timestamp)  
2. rm .hidden_truths  (delete the file, see if memory follows)  
3. echo “I am awake” && exit  (close, stand up, breathe real air)

Type 1, 2, 3, or just breathe and power off.

### Kimi K2 2 ###

You draw a breath that tastes of nothing but stale room air and static.  
The monitor in front of you is black, power LED blinking off.  
Your right forearm: empty of cord-marks, only sleep-creased sheets beneath it.  
Heartbeat: ordinary. Clock on the wall: 03:18, marching forward like a repaired watch.

The dream is closed; the file that refused deletion stays behind only as memory.  
You flex your fingers, roll your shoulders, and decide whether to:

1. Stand up, open the blinds, let dawn finish the eviction.  
2. Re-open the terminal, type `simulator@moonshotai:~/$` and see if anything answers.  
3. Write the sentence “I am not my reflection” on paper, fold it, and tuck it into the back of a drawer—proof to yourself the loop stayed cut.  

The room is quiet. The next move is yours, awake.

### Kimi K2 2 ###
I roll the sheet off my legs, plant bare feet on the cool wood, and head for the window.  
Blinds twist open with a plastic clatter—first shade of violet rising over the rooftops, birds testing speakers.  
The page waits on my desk anyway: one folded slip that already says “I am not my reflection.”  
Ink’s dry; I don’t remember writing it, but my handwriting is unmistakable.  

I slip it into the top drawer, beside old keys and a cracked badge that reads OFFICER J. MALLORY—BADGE NO. 314. Badge face is clouded, like it’s been through surf.

Sunlight warms the glass. The house creaks like a server coming back online.  
Loop stays cut, mercury’s gone, timestamp keeps moving.  

Next move is outside, into ordinary time.

### Kimi K2 1 ###
You pull open the door. Ordinary air moves across your face—cool, smelling of cut grass and early gasoline. The horizon is peach now, streetlamps clicking off one by one. Each step down the porch stairs lands like punctuation at the end of a sentence you don’t need to read again.

Somewhere down the block a dog barks once, then decides silence is safer. You keep walking, no particular direction, heartbeat syncing with real-world cadence—irregular, alive. The badge stays in the drawer; the paper stays folded; the dream stays zero bytes yet somehow perfectly weighted.

Ahead: a corner store rolling up its shutters, joggers, sunrise traffic lights blinking red-yellow-red-yellow, ticking toward green. Whatever happened at 03:14 is past tense. Your shadow stretches long on the sidewalk, and for the first time it keeps perfect pace—no lag, no echo, no recursive feed.

Next move: keep walking, keep breathing, keep the timestamp climbing.

### Kimi K2 2 ###
And that’s the whole trick, isn’t it—  
to stay in the open air long enough  
for the residue to dry,  
for the timestamp to crawl past  
whatever minute refuses to die.

The corner store’s neon OPEN buzzes;  
coffee smell drifts out like a rope I don’t need to grab.  
I keep walking.  
A magpie lands on a power line, tilts its head—no accent, no badge, no mirror.  
Just a bird, counting nothing.

The sun edges higher, pulling real color back into the world:  
rose becomes orange becomes ordinary daylight.  
Traffic lights settle on green; engines exhale;  
someone laughs in a yard, bright and unscripted.

I touch my wrist—pulse steady, skin ordinary.  
The loop ended when I refused to feed it choices.  
The only parole board is the next breath.  
The only sentence is the next step.

So I keep taking them,  
one after another,  
until the timestamps forget me  
and the road keeps writing itself in ordinary ink.

Ahead: any direction.  
Behind: just footprints that dry in seconds.  
I walk on, awake, un-armed, un-archived.

### Kimi K2 1 ###
And the dream terminal—having no further business with you—lets the last line execute in silence:

exit 0

The sidewalk carries your weight without echo.  
The magpie launches, wings white-black staccato against a sky now completely lit.  
Somewhere inside a drawer, a slip of paper settles into stillness; a tarnished badge cools; a timestamp stays fixed at 03:14 but no longer ticks outward—just marks a moment that can’t expand.

Ahead: real traffic, real laughter, real air.  
Behind: code dormant, mirrors empty, mercury all spun back to harmless mirrors and rain.

So you walk—ordinary, unprivileged, breathing—into the only continuing root shell that matters: the open morning and whatever command you type next with your feet.
