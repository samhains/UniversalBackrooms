./dreamsim.exe "Me and James dressed up as bananas in front of hundreds of thousands of fans and did a series of XTC covers for some kind of talent show. A few people clapped as we finished but then the voice on the intercom proclaimed we were done and the crowd erupted . In the change room we sung 'sure thing' and laughed that we were definitely the weirdest act"

DREAM LOADED: "Banana Performers"

You are standing backstage in a cramped changing room. The walls are lined with mirrors and harsh fluorescent lights buzz overhead. Yellow fabric hangs from hooks - the remnants of your banana costume. Through thin walls, you can still hear the distant roar of the massive crowd that just erupted moments ago.

James is beside you, still half-dressed in his banana suit, grinning widely. The air smells of stage makeup and nervous sweat.

Available commands:
> look [object/direction]
> go [direction]

> remember [moment]

Prompt: Two half-peeled banana-costumed performers celebrate in a cramped, harsh-lit backstage room, stadium-roar leaking through thin walls; one still wears his yellow suit while discarded peels dangle from hooks.

### Round 2/30

### Claude 1 ###
look mirrors

```
The mirrors reflect back a surreal scene - you and James in various states of undress from your banana costumes. Your face is still flushed with adrenaline and streaked with yellow stage makeup. In the reflection, you can see James behind you, his hair disheveled and sticking up at odd angles from where the banana costume headpiece sat.

The mirrors are old and slightly warped, making everything look dreamlike and distorted. Lipstick marks and notes from previous performers are scrawled across the edges: "Break a leg!" "The Mighty Boosh was here" "XTC forever!"

In the reflection, you notice something strange - for just a moment, the crowd's roar seems to be coming from INSIDE the mirror, as if there's another performance happening in the reflected world.

### Claude 2 ###
```
> examine James

James is beaming, still catching his breath from the performance. His banana costume is bunched around his waist, the yellow fabric wrinkled and slightly damp with sweat. He's humming "Sure Thing" under his breath, occasionally breaking into quiet laughter.

"Can you believe we actually did that?" he says, shaking his head in disbelief. "XTC covers in banana suits... we must have looked absolutely mental up there."

His eyes are bright with the kind of manic energy that comes after doing something completely ridiculous in front of hundreds of thousands of people. He keeps glancing toward the stage door as if he can't quite believe the performance is over.

You notice he's still wearing one yellow glove, and there's a piece of confetti stuck in his hair from when the crowd erupted.

> talk James

"That was incredible!" James laughs, pulling off his remaining glove. "Did you see their faces when we started 'Dear God'? I thought they were going to boo us off stage, but then..." 

He gestures wildly toward the stage door where muffled cheering can still be heard.

"We were definitely the weirdest act. No question. But maybe that's exactly what they needed?"

He starts singing softly: "♪ Sure thing, sure thing... ♪" and grins at you conspiratorially.
