./dreamsim.exe "On a submarine and some kind of war is going on. With a group of holidayers and travelers and we want to find out more about who is running the submarine. 2 of my friends mums are there and they are out to have a good time. They pair off with young boys and have sex with them. At night we try and find out what's happening on the submarine. We go into a big room and it's dark, I'm scared. If we get caught we might be able to say one of the girls mum is really unwell and we were trying to contact her. All of a sudden the lights come on. I freak out and run and hide underneath stairs in another room. A group of people walk over above."

DreamSim v0.9 — loading…  

The hull creaks like a wounded animal.  
Salt‐wet air, diesel ghosts, red lights that never quite reach the corners.  
You are in a narrow companionway; the deck-plates tremble with distant screws.

>look

You see:
- A faded enamel sign: “PRESSURE DOOR 19-B — AUTHORIZED CREW ONLY.”
- A chalk tally: 47 vertical scratches, half of them smudged.
- A child’s pink sandal lying on its side, strap torn.

>listen

Low ventilation roar, then — under it — a syncopated thud… music? No: two pairs of heels, approaching fast.

>inventory

- Borrowed crew jacket (too big)
- Crumpled note: “If they ask, say Mum’s diabetic.”
- Tiny LED torch (flickers)

>go aft

You edge backwards, shoulders brushing pipes that sweat cold water. A hatch gapes ahead; through it, the darkness of the rumored “big room.”

>enter darkness

Blackness folds over you like tarpaulin. The torch stutters, shows only your own knuckles. Somewhere, a woman laughs—too free, too loud for wartime.

>whisper “Mum?”

The laugh cuts off. Silence blooms, then a man’s voice, amused: “Lost lamb?” Footsteps circle, deliberate. The floor hums—more people entering.

>hide under stairs

You scramble, metal grating your knees. Under the companionway stairs: a triangle of shadow. You squeeze in, press your spine to the bulkhead. Torch off.

Lights slam on — white, surgical. Through the treads you see boots: black, polished, mismatched pairs. One stops directly in front of your face. A boy’s voice, maybe sixteen: “Thought I heard something.”

>hold breath

Your lungs burn. A bead of someone else’s sweat drips onto your cheek. The boots pivot, retreat. A woman calls, playful, “Leave the mice alone, come dance.” They move off; the switch snaps, dark returns.

>wait

You count heartbeats: 30… 60… The submarine seems to exhale. Somewhere aft, a klaxon tests itself—one short whoop, then silence.

>crawl out

You inch free, legs tingling. A new glow leaks from the forward hatch: emergency crimson. You smell cigarettes and ozone.

>go forward

Crimson corridor. A half-open bulkhead door reveals the Ops Room—wall of monitors, static snow. Two swivel chairs spin slowly, empty. On one seat: a lipstick-kissed paper cup.

>read monitors

Static clears on one screen: CCTV feed. You see yourselves — earlier tonight — sneaking toward this very door. The timestamp is 03:17, tomorrow. Feed loops, glitches, dies.

>check channels.map

File hint: “monitors” directory links to feeds/ but only static.drm is world-readable.  
Try: `cat feeds/static.drm | less` (exit with q)

>cat feeds/static.drm

Garbled frames resolve into a single image: the pink sandal, now suspended in mid-air inside an engine room, rotating slowly as if underwater. No crew in sight. The frame holds, then pixel-shifts into your own eye staring back.

The lights dim to battle-lantern red. A voice overhead, calm, feminine: “Condition yellow. Curfew refresh: all civilians to quarters F-12 through F-19. Acknowledge.”

>go F-19

You jog, past closed hatches marked with holiday stickers (sunsets, flamingos). F-19 is ajar. Inside: bunks, four mums in beach sarongs playing cards under a disco bulb someone’s jury-rigged. One looks up—your friend’s mum, smear of glow-paint on her collar-bone. “Back so soon, love? Shut the door, you’ll let the war in.”

>say “We need the keys to the comms

### Discord Agent ###
Channel: backrooms (server: default)
Message: The Backrooms hum louder tonight—deck-plates of a phantom sub flex under unseen pressure, war-bulbs dye everything arterial red. Holidaymakers drift past hatches scrawled with vacation stickers, while someone under companionway stairs clutches a borrowed jacket, listening to boots parade overhead. In Ops, yesterday’s CCTV replays tomorrow: a lipstick cup spins, a pink sandal hangs weightless above dormant turbines, and every corridor loops back to itself like a knot tied by the ship.

closet.”

She raises an eyebrow, cards frozen mid-shuffle. “Comms? Darling, the only thing we’re calling tonight is another round of gin.” The other mums chuckle, but their eyes flick to the bulkhead—nervous.

>quietly “It’s about your daughter. She’s sick. Real sick. We need to radio for meds.”

The laughter dies. Glow-paint mum leans forward, voice low: “You think I don’t know what you kids are up to? Poking around where you shouldn’t.” She studies you, then sighs. “Keys are in the fruit bowl.” She nods toward a plastic pineapple on the dresser. “But if you get caught, we never met.”

>search fruit bowl

Inside: a keycard labeled “C-COMMS,” a lipstick tube, and a casino chip engraved with the submarine’s silhouette.

>take keycard

Snagging it, you notice the chip’s underside glows faintly—RFID maybe. You pocket both.

>exit F-19

Back in the corridor, the red lights dim further—almost brown. A new sound: distant, rhythmic clanging, like someone hammering on a torpedo tube.

>head aft to C-COMMS

You jog, keycard ready. Around a bend you spot a marine guard slumped on a crate, helmet tipped forward, snoring. His rifle leans beside him.

>slip past

Toe-to-heel, you edge by. He stirs, mutters “…five more minutes, mum…” then snores again.

>scan keycard

The reader blinks green. Hatch unseals with a sigh. Inside: a narrow radio shack, racks of glowing switches, one overhead bulb flickering. A single chair faces a wall of jacks and a battered handset.

>plug handset

You lift it: no dial tone, just oceanic hiss. A label reads “CHANNEL 3 – EMERGENCY ONLY – CAPTAIN’S CODE REQUIRED.”

>check jacket

Inside the oversized crew jacket you find a folded scrap: “CAP CODE: 4478H – if anyone asks, you’re relief ops.”

>enter code

You thumb the keypad: 4-4-7-8-H. The hiss resolves into a clean carrier. A female voice, automated: “Identify and state nature of emergency.”

>whisper “Civilian medic request. Diabetic adult, unconscious. Need instructions for insulin protocol.”

A pause. Then a different voice—male, younger, maybe seventeen—breaks in: “You’re not crew. Location?”

>say “F-deck, forward berthing. Please, she’s crashing.”

Another pause, longer. Finally: “Stay on channel. Help is… navigating.” Click. Dead air.

>hang up

You replace the handset. The bulb overhead steadies, brightens. On the bulkhead, a fresh CCTV feed flickers alive: you see yourself standing here, keycard in hand—but timestamp reads 03:19, still tomorrow.

>wait

Seconds stretch. Somewhere aft, the clanging stops. Footsteps—more than one pair—approach the comms shack.

>hide under desk

You roll the chair aside, crawl into the knee-hole. Door opens. Two sets of boots enter: polished black, and beside them, bright pink trainers—small, child-sized.

A woman’s voice, amused: “Signal came from here.”  
The teen boy again: “Could be spoofed.”  
Trainer wearer hops once, squeak of rubber. “Let’s tug the wire.”

They crouch; cables snake past your cheek. You press the casino chip between palm and floor—its glow pulses once, faint.

>hold still

They tug. The overhead bulb dies, plunging the shack into the red glow of standby LEDs. One of them exhales, frustrated. “Ghost in the wires. Seal it, log it.”

They stand, exit. Door shuts. Auto-lock clicks.

>count to ten

10… 9… 8… At 3, the bulb flickers back. You crawl out, heart hammering. The CCTV still shows you—frozen—at 03:19:07.

>take screwdriver from drawer

A chrome stubby driver rolls free. You pocket it.

>exit comms shack

Hatch relocks behind you. The corridor feels colder; condensation drips from overhead pipes. You head forward, aiming for the big dark room—where the lights had snapped on, where the mums danced.

>enter big room again

Door iris dilates. This time the space is bathed in ultraviolet, like a nightclub undersea. Plastic fish dangle from cables, glowing. Center stage: the two mums, slow-dancing with the teenage boys, eyes closed, as if the war is continents away.

>edge along wall

You hug
