simulator@moonshotai:~/.dreamsim$ ./dreamsim.exe "Some guys come over and Nisha disappears from the pram. I find him on the floor crying with his face warped like he has been stepped on. I freak out and start accusing all the people who are now filling up the room at my parents house. I punch someone in the face who tells me his dad has just died. There’s a lot of hatred between me and the people who are at my parents house."

simulator@moonshotai:~/.dreamsim$ walk

> You push past the coats that hang from the banister; they smell of unfamiliar aftershave.  
> The living-room door is ajar. Inside: a crowd of legs, none of them familiar.  
> Their faces are smudged, like thumbs wiped across wet ink.

Available verbs: demand, punch, search, crouch, howl

simulator@moonshotai:~/.dreamsim$ search

> You drop to your knees, shoulder through calves that feel like cold dough.  
> Carpet fibres rise and knit into tiny fingers that tug at your clothes.  
> Beneath the coffee-table you find Nisha: cheek flattened, one eye larger than the other, mouth warped into a perfect circle of silent bawl.  
> He isn’t bleeding; the damage is more like pressure—like someone pressed the idea of a footprint into soft clay.  
> You scoop him; he weighs nothing, but the room tilts as you rise, and every smudged face turns toward you.

Available verbs: cradle, accuse, run, strike, speak

> “My dad died today,” he says, voice flat, “and you’re screaming about a doll.”  
> Something in the sentence lands wrong; the air feels stapled to your skin.

Available verbs: apologise, flee, fight, cradle, freeze

simulator@moonshotai:~/.dreamsim$ cradle

> You clutch Nisha tighter. His warped face slowly unbuckles, features drifting back toward symmetry like wax smoothing under low heat.  
> Around you, the crowd inhales as one lung. Their shoulders roll; a low growl of sympathy for the boy you struck, but also a hesitation—an unspoken recognition that the pram was empty long before they arrived.  
> The floorboards beneath you soften; they feel like the give of a mattress. The boundary between hallway and bedroom dissolves.  
> You realise the house itself is trying to rock you back to steadiness.

Available verbs: forgive, examine, place, surrender, wake

> His eyes open: they’re your eyes, exact hue, but older—decades older.  
> He speaks without moving his mouth: “The stepping was mine; the dropping was yours.”  
> The sentence repeats, layers like an echo in a canyon, until it loses meaning and becomes only rhythm.

The screen fades to black, the cursor stops blinking, and a hush settles—like the moment after a book closes when the story hasn’t quite decided whether it’s over.

The dream is safely off; only the soft echo of your own steady breathing remains, syncing with the quiet of wherever you truly are.

### Kimi K2 2 ###

No prompt waits.  
Only the after-print of your pulse,  
and the knowledge that the pram—  
wherever it really is—  
continues rolling  
under someone else’s steady hands.
