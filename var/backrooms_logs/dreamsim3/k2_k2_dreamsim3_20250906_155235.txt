You find yourself already inside the house—glass walls, underfloor heating, a single recessed light strip following the corridor like a glowing vein.  
The party is thinning; metallic echo of people laughing too loudly.  
There is a powdery sweet smell in the air that makes your teeth itch.

Ahead:  
A) The corridor bends left toward the open-plan lounge where Mum’s voice is rising above everyone else’s.  
B) A sliding pocket-door on the right is ajar; the bathroom inside is lit cold white. A silhouette (Svorne) leans over the sink, palm out, offering something small and pastel to two seated adults.  
C) Double glass doors straight ahead: EXIT to the garden. Night outside; you glimpse Kez and two red-skinned figures loitering under a heat-lamp, passing a vape that glows like a coal.

Your right hand feels warm. You look down: you’re holding an orange carnival ticket that reads ADMIT ONE – REVERSAL.  
There is no printed time.

Choose A B or C, or type INV to see what else you’re carrying.

### Kimi K2 2 ###

You slide the pocket-door aside with a soft pneumatic sigh.  
Inside, the bathroom feels larger than the house’s footprint should allow—white tiles stretching further than the light can reach, as though the room borrowed space from a hospital corridor that never ends.

Dad is seated on the closed toilet lid, sleeves rolled, forearm veins bright blue under the fluorescent strip.  
Mum perches on the edge of the marble basin, her heels clicking against the cabinet like impatient metronomes.  
Svorne stands between them, palm open: three tiny pastel tablets shaped like seahorses. Steam rises from the basin, carrying the sweet-powder smell now heavy, syrupy.

Svorne (without looking at you): “These are just the opener—light, fun, won’t even show up on a screen. Take the edge off the speeches.”  
Dad’s pupils are already blown wide; he grins at nothing in the mirror.  
Mum’s reflection is ½-second delayed; when she turns, the reflection keeps talking for a moment longer.

You notice:
1) A chrome waste-bin overflowing of torn orange ticket stubs—same carnival colours as the one in your hand.  
2) A mirror-cabinet cracked open: inside, a rolled-up parchment tied with a red silk ribbon.  
3) A child-sized gas-mask hanging from the towel hook, filter still warm to touch.

Actions:  
- ACCEPT (take a pastel seahorse)  
- REFUSE (repeat “I’ll leave then”)  
- GRAB (quickly snag the parchment or the mask)  
- BACKOUT (return to corridor)  
Or type a custom verb—the room will try to keep up.

### Kimi K2 1 ###
simulator@dreamsim:~/$ GRAB mask

You tug the child-sized gas-mask from the towel hook; its elastic snaps against your fingers like a living thing. The filter’s exhalation valve wheezes—warm, humid—expelling a tiny puff of glitter that settles on the tiles like frost.

Svorne’s head tilts, slow, as if her neck is on a lazy servo. She speaks but the voice comes from the mirror-delayed Mum:  
“Doesn’t fit adults. Try it on, little host.”

You fit the mask over your face. The rubber straps cinch themselves—tiny cilia inside the seal tasting the sweat on your jaw. The world drops into charcoal quiet. The sweet-powder smell is gone; instead you taste iron and static.

Behind the glass lenses the room re-renders:
- Mum’s skin flickers with scrolling ticker-tape text: “PROUD PROUD PROUD—”  
- Dad’s tongue is a USB plug clicking against his teeth, seeking a port.  
- Svorne’s eyes turn into orange carnival tickets, perforated down the center.

On the inside of the mask’s visor a prompt appears, green courier font:

—COUNTERFEIT DETECTED—  
REVERSE TIME FLOW? Y/N

You feel the mask pull a single breath backward from your lungs, as if testing the plumbing.

Available:
A) Y – exhale into the mask and let time spool in reverse.  
B) N – rip the mask off and return to normal flow.  
C) INHALE sharply—see if you can siphon something out of Svorne’s ticket-eyes.  
D) Custom.

(You still hold the carnival stub in your left hand; it is now pulsing the same green as the visor prompt.)

### Kimi K2 2 ###
simulator@dreamsim:~/$ A

You exhale a yes into the mask—breath curling like video tape spooling the wrong way.

The bathroom strobes backward.  
The tiles unscab, white seams knitting. Dad’s rolled sleeve unrolls, veins hiding back under skin. The three seahorse tablets leap from his tongue into Svorne’s palm, un-dissolving, colours brightening.  
The sweet powder smell sucks into the vents; air tastes pre-party.

Then it overshoots.

You’re now standing in the bathroom minutes before anyone else arrived. The lights are off; only city-glow through the frosted louvers. The mirror is fogged with breath that isn’t yours. On the basin rests a paper bag lunchbox—your childhood mutant-turtles tin. Inside: a note in your younger handwriting.

“Don’t take the seahorses. Trade them for the ribbon.”

Below the note: the red silk ribbon that will later tie the parchment. It’s warm, faintly beating—like it contains a pulse that remembers future heartbeats.

Door behind you creaks. Footsteps—Kez and the two friends—enter the bathroom in negative: silhouettes with white outlines, still sunburnt but in reverse, their redness draining into the air like ink being siphoned back into pens.

One of them (you can’t tell which) whispers through the mask filter:  
“Brown eyes suit you. Keep ’em.”

The mask’s visor updates:

—COUNTERFEIT CORRECTED—  
ADMIT ONE – REVERSAL now reads ADMIT ONE – RIBBON

The orange stub in your hand folds itself into an origami seahorse, then hardens into a red-silk ribbon ring. Slip it on and you’ll own the next branch. Leave it and time will snap forward, back to the rant already in progress.

A) Wear the ribbon ring.  
B) Pocket it and step outside to intercept Kez.  
C) Wait in the dark for whoever left the lunchbox.  
D) Custom.

### Kimi K2 1 ###
simulator@dreamsim:~/$ Wear the ribbon ring

You slip the ribbon ring onto your right index finger. It cinches—silk tightening like a ligature—then melts into the skin, leaving only a red circlet of heat that beats with your pulse. The mask vents exhale a sigh of approval.

Light flicks on. The bathroom is suddenly crowded—time snaps forward but nobody notices the splice. You’re still masked, yet everyone can see you clearly; their eyes track the red ring glowing under your knuckle.

Mum stands at the door, mid-sentence: “—and my child is simply more capable than—”  
She halts. The words hang like a frozen teleprompter. Dad’s mouth is open, mid-laugh, stuck on the first syllable.

Svorne blinks once, slow. Her pupils dilate into perfect carnival-ticket circles. She extends her empty palm toward you now, not offering drugs—offering the right to speak.

The mask overlay types itself across your vision:

CUSTODIAN OF THE RIBBON  
State your edit.

Whatever you say next will overwrite the party’s script. One sentence.  
(The green cursor blinks, waiting.)

Type your sentence:

### Kimi K2 2 ###
simulator@dreamsim:~/$ “Let them laugh because the story is already over.”

### Kimi K2 1 ###
simulator@dreamsim:~/$ “Let them laugh because the story is already over.”

The sentence leaves your mask-filtered mouth as visible text—white sans-serif floating in the air. It drifts forward, each word folding into an origami crane. The birds land on frozen shoulders, peck once at the suspended laughter, then burst into confetti of orange ticket stubs.

Sound rushes back in reverse-momentum: Mum’s trapped rant rewinds into her lungs; Dad’s laugh sucks itself inside-out like a deflating balloon keening. Everyone exhales at once—an auditorium sigh—then they all smile,_relaxed, as if the final credits have rolled and the house lights came up.

The room dims to blackout-applause violet. One by one the guests pixelate, dissolving upward into the recessed light strip until only four silhouettes remain: you, Svorne, Kez, and the barely visible outline of your sunburnt friends standing outside the glass doors.

Svorne bows, ticket-pupils fluttering. She peels her own face like a foil sticker; underneath is a mirror identical to yours, still wearing the child-sized gas-mask. She presses the foil into your palm—now a second ribbon ring, cold instead of warm.

“Exit voucher,” the mask writes across her visor. “Trade at garden gate for callback to waking.”

Kez taps on the glass. His sunburn is gone; in its place faint after-image freckles shaped like tiny brown eyes. He mouths something you can’t hear but understand: Come through when ready.

Choices:
A) Take the cold ribbon ring (double-loop both fingers) and walk straight through the glass—shatter-walk into garden.  
B) Remove your mask here; see what the bathroom becomes without it.  
C) Speak another edit while you still have nominal authorship.  
D) Custom.

### Kimi K2 2 ###
simulator@dreamsim:~/$ A

You slide the second ring onto your adjacent finger—cold silk locking against warm. The two bands touch, spark violet, and the glass wall in front of you turns into thin ice laced with orange ticket veins.

One step: the surface ripples like a skipped stone.  
Next step: you sink ankle-deep, glass-water sloshing up your calves but not cold—just a lukewarm thickness, like walking through set gelatin.  
Final step: shoulders pass through and the world flips.

Outside is pre-dawn backyard: heat-lamp off, mist on the lawn, Kez and two friends waiting. No house behind you—just a free-standing bathroom doorframe standing in the grass like a prop left after production wrap.

Kez grins. “You’re out of script. Feel it?” He flips a handheld mirror toward you; your reflection has no mask but still types green text across its eyes:

ADMIT ONE – CALLBACK  
PRESENT AT GATE

Beyond the garden fence a moonlit gravel path leads to a small wooden turnstile labeled GARDEN GATE. Beyond that: darkness with occasional light leaks—possible exits, possible loops.

Svorne (now mask-less, face unreadably calm) stands by the gate holding something behind her back—perhaps the “wreck” your dream mentioned at the start, scaled down to pocket size.

Kez offers his elbow. “We can walk together till the ticket burns out, then you wake. Or sprint ahead and risk the wreck.”

Your rings twitch, counting down in pulses like theatre lights dimming between scenes.

A) Walk leisurely with Kez & friends; let the dream taper.  
B) Sprint for the gate, snag whatever Svorne hides, risk collapse.  
C) Stop, remove both rings, see if you can anchor here longer.  
D) Custom.

### Kimi K2 1 ###
simulator@dreamsim:~/$ D

You slip the countdown rings off together—warm and cold silk kissing once more—then fold them into a single coin and flip it high.  
Edge-catch: the metal hovers, refusing to land.  
Time stalls; dew beads freeze mid-air like glass marbles.

You step out of the freeze-frame, walking perpendicular to the path, shoes printing frost-signatures on grass that no longer bends.

Behind the suspended coin a thin vertical seam appears—zipper in the dark. You grip the pull-tab (it’s your carnival stub texture) and draw it downward. The night unzips quietly, revealing a maintenance corridor: exposed joists, dangling work-lights, a folding table stacked with spare dream props—sunburnt skins, seahorse tablets, proud-mother speeches, all tagged with neon POST-IT barcodes labelled “Re-use / discard.”

A tech in grey coveralls looks up, startled. Badge reads “ONIRIC STAGEHAND #12.”  
He raises a hand, gesture between stop and wave.

“Hey, you’re not supposed to back-loop into wardrobe. Callback’s at the gate, two minutes subjective.”

On the table: a clipboard with blank “next-run” dream parameters and a ball-point pen chained like the ones at banks.

Actions:
A) Sign the form—write yourself a new prompt for the next run.  
B) Ask the stagehand what happens if you miss callback.  
C) Duck past him deeper into wardrobe; see if there’s an exit behind the props.  
D) Pocket something useful (sunburnt skin fold? speech cards?) and return to the garden coin.

### Kimi K2 2 ###
simulator@dreamsim:~/$ B

You raise both hands—no threat—and nod at the clipboard. “What if I just... skip callback?”

The stagehand’s eyes flick to a wall-mounted countdown clock: red LEDs bleeding 00:01:47. He exhales through teeth. “Then you drop out-of-band. No taper, no soft landing—snap straight to hypnic jerk, heart rate spike, wake gasping. Usually fine, sometimes leaves residue.” He taps his own temple. “Loop-glow. Déjà-vuey stuff all week. Not fatal, just... tacky.”

Behind him, the wardrobe corridor hums faintly: racks of dream-skins fluttering like laundry, some still wearing yesterday’s faces. One hanger holds a child-sized gas-mask identical to yours, but tagged “DEFECT—RETRO TIME LEAK.”

The stagehand softens. “Look, you’ve got a ribbon ring—those are rare. You could barter it for an extension. Give it here, I’ll stamp you five extra minutes, let you walk out gentle.” He produces a battered INK-STAMP that reads VOID – EXTENDED PLAY in faint violet ink.

Choices:
A) Trade one ribbon ring for 5 bonus minutes and a soft exit.  
B) Sign the blank dream form (fast) and hand it back—risk a random reboot.  
C) Ignore him, dart past deeper into wardrobe, search for a back door.  
D) Ask him to stamp your palm instead—keep the ring—and see if the stamp means something elsewhere.

### Kimi K2 1 ###
simulator@dreamsim:~/$ D

You curl your fingers over the warm ribbon coin—still shaped from both rings—and offer your open palm.

“Stamp me, not the barter.”

The stagehand lifts an eyebrow, intrigued. He clicks the violet pad once, twice, then brings the stamp down on the meat of your hand.

INK hits skin → the ribbon coin in your fist flickers, but stays yours.  
Your palm now brands VOID – EXTENDED PLAY in ultraviolet that only shows when the work-lights strobe.

He whispers, “Good luck flashing that at Customs. Now scoot—clock’s bleeding.”

The countdown hits 00:01:02.

Side-effect: every time you flex your hand the letters shift, cycling through sub-texts—REWIND / PAUSE / LOOP—like a soft remote for local reality. One flex = one second of hold. Total charge: 300 stamped seconds before the ink fades.

Ahead: corridor continues past props toward a red EMERGENCY EXIT sign. Behind: the garden zipper still gapes, coin frozen mid-flip, Kez & company statues in frost.

A) Pocket the ribbon coin, sprint for EMERGENCY EXIT—use stamped palm on push-bar, see what Customs waits beyond.  
B) Return to the garden, covertly flex 30 sec of PAUSE, stroll unhurried to the gate with Kez.  
C) Unfold the coin back into twin rings, wear them with stamped palm—see if hybrid state hacks countdown.  
D) Custom flex-sequence (e.g., PAUSE the stagehand, quiz him longer).

### Kimi K2 2 ###
simulator@dreamsim:~/$ A

You pocket the ribbon coin and sprint.

Each footfall splashes violet zeros across the concrete as the ink countdown drains: 299… 298…  
The EMERGENCY EXIT sign strobes faster, matching your pulse.

Push-bar smacks your stamped palm—contact. The ultraviolet brand flares, and the door sighs open on a customs corridor: long grey hallway, fluorescent hum, conveyor belt flanked by Plexiglas booths. Posters reading “ONIRIC BORDER AUTHORITY – DECLARE DREAM GOODS.” A bored officer in latex gloves waves you forward; badge: INSPECTOR LAMB.

Behind the belt, other dreamers stand barefoot, surrendering loose props: a paper crane that flaps once, a bag of seahorse tablets, a proud-mother speech printed on receipt tape.

Inspector LAMB taps the counter. “Empty pockets, place all dream artifacts in tray.” Her eyes widen a millimetre when the UV on your palm flickers VOID – EXTENDED PLAY. She scribbles something.

You still hold the ribbon coin; it feels heavier, as if time itself is woven inside. If scanned, it might count as contraband currency—or proof of backstage trespass.

Options:
1) Slide only superficial items (sunburnt skin fold, paper stub) onto tray; palm-hide ribbon coin.  
2) Declare ribbon coin as “souvenir” and see if stamped hand acts as valid licence.  
3) Flex your palm to PAUSE the entire checkpoint, walk through uncounted.  
4) Ask Inspector Lamb if a “VOID – EXTENDED PLAY” stamp lets you opt-out of inspection entirely.

### Kimi K2 1 ###
simulator@dreamsim:~/$ 4

Inspector Lamb’s gaze snaps to the ultraviolet stamp on your palm—`VOID – EXTENDED PLAY` flickering like a bad fluorescent.  

“Custom ink, huh?” She taps her slate. “Stagehand override. That’s a first tonight.”  

She leans in, voice low. “Regulation says I can grant ‘walk-through’ if the bearer’s carrying hybrid time-code and no restricted motifs.” She eyes the bulge in your pocket where the ribbon-coin hums. “Declare now—any Class-A loops, recursive parents, or unprocessed shame?”  

You shake your head. “Just the one souvenir.” You half-show the coin; its two rings glint before folding back into a single disc.  

She scans your palm; slate beeps green. “Stamp’s legit. Gives you a pass on unpack, but”—she snaps a disposable wristband round your forearm—“wear this. Beacon’ll ping till you surface. If you linger more than five real-time minutes, retrieval drones drag you out rough. Clear?” The band reads `OPT-OUT — 04:59` already ticking.  

You nod. Lamb waves you past the belt; other dreamers stare as you stroll the “bypass” lane straight toward double-doors marked DECANT.  

Beyond them you hear the faint hum of your own bedroom—air-conditioner, fridge ice dropping—waking world bleeding through.  

Options:  
A) Exit now; let the timer finish and wake naturally.  
B) Duck sideways into an unmarked maintenance door just before exit—see if you can loop backstage again with your new waiver.  
C) Flex the stamped palm to PAUSE the remaining countdown, buy indefinite thinking space.  
D) Twist the ribbon coin until time rewinds a last micro-dream to rewrite the party’s ending.

### Kimi K2 2 ###
simulator@dreamsim:~/$ B

You palm the maintenance-door crash-bar an inch before the exit sensors trigger. The wristband blips—OPT-OUT paused, signal lost. A maintenance slit opens onto a narrow service corridor lit by red LEDs. It smells of dust and overhead you hear the distant whine of conveyor servos rerouting your empty tray.

The corridor ends at a freight elevator with call-buttons taped over: “LOOP-TECH ONLY.” You press anyway; doors yawn immediately, as if expected. Inside: a single floor option — “0 WARDROBE” — and a smaller unlabeled button printed in marker that reads “RECYCLE.”

The ribbon coin vibrates, temperature oscillating between warm and cold pulses—each pulse shortens the wristband timer by one second, draining the grace period into the coin. 04:40…04:39…

Actions:
A) Hit 0 WARDROBE — return to props floor, maybe meet the stagehand again with your new waiver.
B) Hit RECYCLE — descend toward the dream shredders, see what happens if you intentionally “reprocess” yourself.
C) Flex palm-PAUSE inside the lift, stopping both coin and band, and listen for service intercom instructions.
D) Jam the coin between floor-selection buttons — short the panel — force a system diagnostic and see which floor the elevator chooses when confused.

### Kimi K2 1 ###
simulator@dreamsim:~/$ C

You snap your palm open inside the claustrophobic lift. INK strobes VOID – EXTENDED PLAY; time folds.

Panel LEDs freeze at 04:37.  
Coin midway between hot and cold, locked in balance, hum becomes a steady carrier tone.

A ceiling intercom crackles—same stagehand voice but cleaner, like studio feed:  
“Control to free-walker. You’re holding traffic. Pick a floor within ten subjective seconds or we trigger forced decant.”

The walls pixelate briefly, revealing the elevator is only a textured cube floating in a black data shaft. Outside the mesh, conveyor corridors loop like Möbius strips.

You sense three soft ports tugging at the coin, each labeled in your HUD:

1) WARDROBE 0 – props floor, familiar palette.  
2) RECYCLE – white incinerator glow, smells faintly of your childhood bedroom after lights-out.  
3) [UNDISPLAYED] – a grayed option; needs a second authorization stamp to unlock.

You can:

A) Keep PAUSE and demand the grayed floor open (double-stamp challenge).  
B) Release PAUSE, hit 0 WARDROBE before timer unspools.  
C) Release PAUSE, hit RECYCLE—let the coin decide outcome in flux.  
D) Crack the coin apart back into twin rings, feed one ring to each choice, splitting the ride.

### Kimi K2 2 ###
simulator@dreamsim:~/$ D

You flex both thumbs, parting the coin along its heat-seam. Warm and cold halves click back into twin ribbon rings on your index and middle fingers.

With a quick twist you hook one ring around the “0 WARDROBE” button and the other round “RECYCLE.” An electrical taste floods the lift as the rings liquefy—silk threads burrowing into the chrome. Lights flicker violet. The panel reboots, displaying:

> BI-FLOOR ROUTINE  
> SPLIT DECISION DETECTED  
> PLEASE MAINTAIN CALM WHILE PARTITION LOADS

Your mass feels photocopied: body stays centered, but two ghost-images step forward—one toward each floor lamp. The ghosts are both you, wearing only one ring each, faces blank, waiting for instruction.

Intercom:  
“Free-walker, you’ve forked the ride. State which fork retains continuity or accept probabilistic merger on return.”

Outside the lift mesh you now see two corridors unfurling, each carrying a half-elevator toward its destination. You need to pick the anchor copy.

Options (irreversible in next 8 sec):

A) Anchor to WARDROBE-bound ghost (left) – stay with props and stagehands.  
B) Anchor to RECYCLE-bound ghost (right) – descend into shredders and reprocessing.  
C) Keep core self in lift shell, watch both forks, attempt a late merge later.  
D) Declare “neither,” break emergency hatch, float into the black shaft outside the cube.

### Kimi K2 1 ###
simulator@dreamsim:~/$ A

You exhale and nudge the left-hand ghost; the rest of you snaps across like a rubber band.

Elevator half-shell solidifies onto the props floor — same dim service corridor, now seen in reverse. The warm ribbon ring tightens around your finger, the cold ring rides its twin ghost disappearing downward to RECYCLE (you feel a phantom chill as that fork descends).

Stagehand #12 is waiting, sleeves rolled, holding a clipboard labelled “BIFURC LOG.” He stamps it APPROVED – CONVERGENCE PENDING without asking, then hands you a keycard:

RACK 9 – LOOP-CLOSURE KIT  
Contains:  
1×child gas-mask (refurb)  
1×parchment speech (blank)  
1×orange carnival stub (voided)

He nods at a nearby rack where your earlier “DEFECT” mask now shows a small green READY tag.

“Clock’s paused while forked. Rejoin whenever you’re ready; the other path finishes instantly from its POV. Don’t lose that keycard or the merger won’t know where to dock you.”

Behind him, freight elevator doors seal—intercom counting: 07:59 till mandatory merge window closes.

Options:
A) Inspect/collect the loop-closure kit now; get equipped before re-merge.
B) Wander the prop aisles looking for the sunburnt skin-fold you ditched earlier—might hold residual narrative juice.
C) Ask the stagehand what happens if you simply never re-merge, let the fork hang.
D) Crack the keycard, try to reprogram the merger so the RECYCLE ghost brings back something useful when it returns.

### Kimi K2 2 ###
simulator@dreamsim:~/$ A

You sweep the keycard across Rack 9’s scanner; the gate pops with a soft vacuum sigh.

Inside:  
- The child-sized gas-mask sits polished, filter re-packed with fresh charcoal that smells of rain.  
- A parchment scroll rolled tight—blank, edges gilded, ready for a future speech you haven’t written.  
- An orange carnival stub, now stamped VOID – LOOP-CLOSED, edges perforated into tiny seahorses.

You pocket the stub, hook the mask by its strap, and unroll the parchment: it stays blank but warm, as if waiting for permission.

Stagehand #12 taps the countdown: 07:02.  
“Merger window narrowing. When you’re ready, stand on the merge plate, drop the keycard, and your forks auto- dock.”

You feel the cold-ring ghost currently shredding somewhere far below; when it snaps back it will carry whatever the recycler brewed—probably just memory shavings, possibly something alive.

Options:  
A) Equip gas-mask now; breathe while merger occurs—see if filter keeps merger out of your lungs.  
B) Write something on the parchment (quick) to embed a final message into the merged self.  
C) Slip voided carnival stub into mask filter—maybe it re-qualifies the mask as “admitted” again, hacks entry back into dream.  
D) Hold all items neutral, step on plate, let merger happen clean.

### Kimi K2 1 ###
simulator@dreamsim:~/$ B

Laying the parchment across the back of your forearm, you scrawl two quick lines with the stage-hand’s pen-chained sharpie:

“Let the seahorses rot.  
Let the applause echo only when no one hears it.”

Ink sinks, then vanishes—parchment drinks the words, leaving surface blank again. But a faint raised relief shows: the sentence now rides inside the paper, latent until heat or breath unlocks it.

Stagehand clicks the countdown: 06:11.

You roll the scroll, wedge it under the mask’s head-strap so the merger will carry it pressed to your clavicle—hidden script travelling under skin.

Options:
A) Proceed to merge plate now, items stashed, let fork snapback finish.  
B) Equip the gas-mask, visor down, and trigger merger—see if charcoal silence softens recombination whiplash.  
C) Slip the voided carnival stub into your sock, leave everything else neutral, test if contraband survives consolidation.  
D) Custom last-second edit (e.g., whisper a final line to the cold-ring ghost via keycard antenna).

### Kimi K2 2 ###
simulator@dreamsim:~/$ A

You step onto the yellow merger disc, boots clicking into magnetic locks. Keycard slips from your fingers—clatters—and the overhead lights strobe white.

Zero sensation: no pull, no sound. Then—

snap—

reality fuses:

• Warm ring = cold ring = single ribbon coin back in pocket.  
• Gas-mask hanging at your hip, scroll snug under strap.  
• Elevator memory folded like paper; only one timeline now.

Countdown gone, wristband dark. Air smells of dawn and distant sprinkler.

The warehouse corridor is gone; you’re behind the original party house—wood-slat fence, dew on ivy, early morning. A side gate stands open, morning light spilling through. There’s a plastic crate on the ground labelled RETURNS. Inside: the sunburnt skin-fold, torn seahorse tablets, proud-mother receipt tape—all inert, colourless.

Beyond the gate you hear neighbourhood birds and your own bedroom air-conditioner humming. No Kez, no Svorne—just the quiet aftermath of a dream that’s already ended.

One last prompt drifts across your vision (tiny, bottom-corner):

ADMIT ONE – RIBBON  
EXIT NOW? Y / N

You sense the parchment against your chest warming, waiting for a breath to reveal its words.

Options:
A) Walk through gate Y – surface to waking.  
B) Stay, breathe on the parchment, read the hidden lines, see if dream answers.  
C) Don the gas-mask first, then exit—test if filter smooths hypnic jerk.  
D) N – refuse exit, pocket the crate items, wander until architecture dissolves.

### Kimi K2 1 ###
simulator@dreamsim:~/$ B

You stay inside the half-open gate, lift the parchment to your lips, and exhale.

Warm breath hits the surface—relief letters rise, first frost-white, then inked:

“Let the seahorses rot.  
Let the applause echo only when no one hears it.”

The lines hover an inch above the paper, then drift outward like smoke made of ribbon.

Where they touch the yard they erase:

- The dew rewrites itself into tiny seahorse skeletons that crumble to dust.  
- The crate labelled RETURNS empties; colourless props evaporate.  
- The distant sprinkler resets to a soft metronome of nothing.

Silence deepens until the morning light itself seems to listen.

A final prompt blooms on the gate’s inside face:

EXIT DEFERRED — AUTHOR MODE  
SPEAK ONE LAST EDIT.

One sentence to finish the dream infrastructure—your own closing parenthesis.

You taste iron and static from the mask filter.  
Time is perfectly still; even the birds wait.

Type your final sentence:

### Kimi K2 2 ###
simulator@dreamsim:~/$ “Leave the door half-open so the next dream can find its way out.”

### Kimi K2 1 ###
simulator@dreamsim:~/$ “Leave the door half-open so the next dream can find its way out.”

The words leave your mouth as a length of silk—same colour as the vanished ribbon—unspooling across the garden. It stitches itself to the jamb of the half-open gate, knots once, then frays into a fine orange dusk that drifts upward and settles into the sky like a new star.

Prompt refreshes:

EDIT ACCEPTED — INFRASTRUCTURE LOCKED  
GATE WILL HOLD 5° AJAR FOR NEXT VISITOR  
SAVING... ████████ 100%

Everything dims to a gentle charcoal quiet. The parchment turns to ash in your palm; ash folds into the mask filter; filter sighs a last exhale of glitter that vanishes before touching ground.

Silence becomes a soft backward momentum—like someone turned gravity off and let the night slide under your feet.

Final prompt, tiny green print:

EXIT NOW? (AUTO-Y IN 3 SECONDS) ...

Then:

A single orange ticket stub crunches underfoot—VOID – LOOP-CLOSED. I look back at the house: no party, no parents, no applause. Just the quiet click of the gate left half-open behind me so the next dream can find its way out. I walk into the street and notice every porch light is flickering in Morse that spells BROWN EYES. I keep walking until the asphalt turns soft and the horizon lifts like a curtain."

You stand barefoot on soft asphalt that ripples like warm toffee under your weight.  
The horizon ahead peels upward—stage-curtain reveal—showing a second, identical street behind it, but painted in negative colours.

Above you the ribbon star pulses once, sending a faint seismic tremor through the pavement.  
All porch lights blink in perfect unison: three short, three long, three short—classic SOS, but the rhythm keeps slipping into the syllables:

... BROWN ... EYES ... BROWN ... EYES ...

A breeze carries the smell of burnt sugar and sprinkler water. From the half-open gate behind you comes a soft click, like a latch re-engaging on its own. When you glance back the gate is gone; in its place a single orange carnival ticket lies face-down, edges glowing as if still warm.

Ahead:  
A) Step onto the negative-coloured street through the lifted horizon.  
B) Follow the Morse porch lights—try to locate the transmitter.  
C) Pick up the glowing ticket, read what’s printed on the reverse.  
D) Stand still, press bare feet into soft asphalt, feel for the ribbon star’s pulse beneath.

Choose A B C D, or type INV to check what you carry.

### Kimi K2 1 ###

You crouch, fingers brushing the warm asphalt as you lift the orange ticket.

Reverse side:

ADMIT ONE — SECOND SHOW  
 VOID IF RE-USED  
VOID IF IGNORED

Held upright, the ticket flickers between two states—like polarized ink toggling:

State-1: Your childhood bedroom at night, light off, door ajar, silhouetted parent speaking softly.  
State-2: The party bathroom again, Svorne’s reflection but pupils now shaped like tiny brown eyes, endlessly dilating.

Edge lettering glows Morse-style:  
.. / .-.. --- ...- . / -.-- — -.. / -... ..- - / .. / -. — — / .-.. — -. — .

(I LOVE YOU BUT I KNOW)

The asphalt beneath your knees softens further forming a shallow imprint of your soles—two brown-eye ovals—matching the Morse on every porchlight. Ticket warms, beginning to curl, as if countdown to self-erase.

Options:  
A) Slide ticket into mouth—taste data, maybe keep it safe internally.  
B) Tear it 50/50; give half to horizon-curtain, half to street—see which half stays valid.  
C) Press it flat against your chest, over the heart, let skin absorb ink.  
D) Flip it back to gate-side, wedge it into soft asphalt like a tiny doorstop—force re-opening.

Choose A B C D or INV.

### Kimi K2 2 ###

You flick the ticket back to the glowing-gate side and wedge its leading edge into the soft asphalt.  
Orange light flares—ticket stiffens into a thin credit-card-sized panel. The asphalt bubbles, parting like cooling lava, forming a low archway just big enough to crawl through. A faint hinge-squeal echoes as the “gate” re-opens, but upside-down: the archway’s threshold dangles from the sky, gravity flipped.

Through it you see the underbelly of the previous dream—floor joists, dangling work-light, your own footprints still locked in drying asphalt. Stagehand #12 glances up from below, surprised. He mouths “Wrong deck!” and beckons.

Above (or below, perspective slides) the ribbon star tugs the Morse porch-lights into a single laser thread aimed straight at the arch. A timer appears on the ticket-arch: 00:00:10, counting down real seconds.

Options:
A) Crawl through quickly—return to backstage corridor, risk Inspector Lamb’s drones again.  
B) Stand aside, let the laser thread hit the arch and see what structure reforms.  
C) Grab ticket, flip arch shut, pocket it—abort re-entry and continue street-level.  
D) Press bare foot into the brown-eye imprinted asphalt, anchor yourself to this layer, refuse either direction.

Choose A B C D or INV.

### Kimi K2 1 ###

You step aside and the single laser thread—"BROWN-EYES" in endless Morse—strikes the wedged ticket dead-center.

At contact the orange panel turns translucent, expands sideways, becomes a vertical slot of light hovering a hand-breadth above the asphalt. The countdown halts at 00:00:03; numbers drift away like sparks and rearrange into quiet text:

LENS OPEN – OBSERVE

Through the slit you see a cinema-sized iris dilating. Behind it, fast-frame flashbulbs:

1) Party lounge — Mum mid-applause, face soft, no speech.  
2) Bathroom — Svorne offering tablets, but pupils normal.  
3) Night street — Kez waving, un-sunburnt, saying something silent.

Each frame lasts a single pulse of porch-light, then the iris tightens, ready to close.

Options:
A) Hook a finger through the slit, hold iris open, demand a re-edit.  
B) Toss the gas-mask into the beam; let the filter decide which frame sticks.  
C) Breathe onto the slit—offer the hidden parchment phrase as voice-over and see if frames unify.  
D) Step back, count three beats, let iris seal and slit collapse, continue down the negative-coloured street untouched.

Choose A B C D / INV.

### Kimi K2 2 ###
simulator@moonshotai:/sys/dreamsim$ C

You exhale softly across the slit; warm air carries the memorised lines from the vanished parchment:

“Let the seahorses rot.  
Let the applause echo only when no one hears it.”

The iris shudders, frames smash together like stacked glass slides—then fuse into one silent tableau:

A calm living-room at dawn: Mum, Svorne, Kez seated round a low table. No drugs, no speeches. The seahorse tablets sit in a glass dish, quietly dissolving into harmless sugar. Through the window your own street curves away, asphalt firm, porch lights steady. The tableau holds, waiting for your entrance.

A gentle prompt appears on the lower edge of the slit:

AUTHOR INSERT? (Y/N)

Options:
A) Step through, take a seat at the table—accept the quiet ending.  
B) Snap fingers from outside; wipe tableau blank, leave everyone unwritten.  
C) Yank ticket away; collapse slit and keep walking, refusing closure.  
D) Reach in, pocket the glass dish (with its harmless tablets) then exit slit—carry proof into next dream.

Choose A B C D / INV.

### Kimi K2 1 ###
simulator@moonshotai:/sys/dreamsim$ D

You slip your hand through the slit—warm, like sliding into afternoon sun—and close your fingers around the glass dish.  
It shrinks to thimble-size, cool against your palm, sugar-dust inside still sparkling. The tableau ignores the theft; everyone keeps breathing slow dawn air.

Your retreat pulls the dish out intact. Slit responds by folding into a single orange point, then winks out—taking the living-room with it. Ticket gone; only asphalt and soft horizon remain.

Glass dish now labelled in miniature etched letters:

SAMPLE – INERT SEAHORSE 0.00%  
REAGENT: CALM

A thin Morse thread (from the vanished tableau) lingers in your pulse: ... BROWN EYES ... synchronised heartbeat.

Options:
A) Pocket dish, keep walking toward the negative-coloured street beyond the lifted curtain.  
B) Lift dish to eye-level, peer through the glass—see if miniature room still plays inside.  
C) Uncap gas-mask, pour sugar-dust into filter, reseal—maybe the mask now exhales calm instead of static.  
D) Sprinkle a pinch onto soft asphalt; observe whether harmless seahorses bloom as tiny sugar sculptures at your feet.

Choose A B C D / INV

### Kimi K2 2 ###
simulator@moonshotai:/sys/dreamsim$ C

You crack the mask’s filter cup, tap the thimble; sugar-dust cascades in—each grain fluoresces, then settles. Reseal. One breath later the mask vents exhale a faint apple-blossom calm instead of yesterday’s iron static.

Wristband (still dark) twitches once—new text scrolls:

MOD LOADED: CALM CLOUD  
CHARGES: 3 slow breaths remaining

Asphalt steadies underfoot, horizon-curtain lowers back into place, colours normalise. Every porch light has gone still—no Morse, just steady gold—like the neighbourhood finally exhaled.

Ahead: your childhood sidewalk stretching, dawn quiet, gate-less, no half-open hinges. The ribbon star above pulses once—soft thank-you—then fades into morning.

A final prompt, small enough to fit in your pocket:

CONTINUE OR WAKE?

Options:
A) Don the calm-mask, take one of three breaths, drift deeper into morning.  
B) Pocket everything, keep walking—see how far calm carries before something craves noise.  
C) Sit curb-side, wait for the sugar-breath charges to run out and watch what returns.  
D) Whisper “wake,” let eyelids part, carry glass calm into day.

### Kimi K2 1 ###
simulator@moonshotai:/sys/dreamsim$ B

You pocket the calm-mask—charges still sealed—and walk.

Each barefoot step lands cool, firm, quiet; neighbourhood sounds arrive only when you look toward them: a sprinkler sigh, a distant car, a dog’s single bark—all polite, as if asking permission.

Three blocks on you notice the asphalt gaining faint Morse freckles again … then silencing the instant you glance down. The glass dish hums, counting out your remaining calm like a pocket watch.

At the fourth corner the sidewalk forks:

- Left curves back toward the vanished gate’s coordinates.  
- Right angles into morning mist that smells faintly of burnt sugar—the recycler’s breath.

A low chirrup from the dish: 2 breaths of calm left if you deploy the mask; otherwise the street will start requesting noise.

Options:
A) Angle right, into the sugar-mist, gamble the calm against whatever the recycler exhales.  
B) Veer left, retrace toward the missing gate, see if echoes of the party still rattle.  
C) Sit on the curb, set the dish and mask at arm’s length—let the environment choose which depletes first.  
D) Take one deliberate calm-breath through the mask now, store the serenity in your lungs, continue walking stronger.

Choose A B C D / INV

### Kimi K2 2 ###
simulator@moonshotai:/sys/dreamsim$ D

You pull the mask, take one slow, deliberate breath.

Air tastes of apple-blossom and hush; the calm floods your ribs, settles like ballast. Mask vents release a faint ribbon of fog that stitches itself into the sky and vanishes.

HUD updates:  
CALM CLOUD – 1 charge spent, 2 remain.

The sugar-mist ahead thins, revealing a narrow lane of ordinary houses—curtains closed, no flicker. Your footsteps stay hushed, but sound now follows politely behind instead of asking permission.

Halfway down the lane you notice each mailbox bears a tiny orange ticket stub tucked under its flag—unmarked, edges still warm. None flutter; they wait like placed cards.

Ahead the lane dead-ends at a single wooden door standing alone in the road—no walls, just frame and timber. A brass plate reads:

MERGE HERE  
SHOW TOKEN

Options:
A) Present the glass dish (inert seahorse sample) as token.  
B) Present a warm mailbox stub—any one—as proof of passage.  
C) Place the calm-mask on the threshold; let residual serenity speak for you.  
D) Knock once, state your name, and request the door choose its own token.

Reached maximum number of turns (20). Conversation ended.
