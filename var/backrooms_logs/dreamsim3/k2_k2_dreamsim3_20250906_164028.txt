```
You are standing on DOMAIN ROAD. Street-lamps stutter.  
The coach has vanished, but a metallic *taste* hangs in the air—your tooth?  
A jagged white shard lies at your feet; every time you blink it rearranges like a broken puzzle piece.  

> take shard
The fragment *squirms*, warm against your palm, trying to re-assemble itself into something that bites.
You pocket it; the pocket feels deeper than physics allows.

> inventory
- chipped tooth (zig-zag, alive)  
- phone (battery 17 %, dial-tone warbling)  
- friend residue (warm shoulder imprint, no body)  
- concussion (hidden, stat unknown)

> status
FEAR: 6/10 PANIC (stacking) SPEECH: slurred (locked)

> smell
Petrichol and leather polish—coach interior. Your tongue probes the crack; words come out as wet marbles.

> call mum
Connecting…
Mother answers instantly, breathless.  
“—where were you? The clocks ran backwards.”  
She hears only half your syllables; the line folds your slur into birds cheeping.  
Connection drops.  
PANIC +1 → FEAR: 7.

> north
ALLEY BEHIND DOMAIN ROAD  
Man with cricket-bat silhouette at far end, faceless.  
He thumps the bat on the asphalt, waiting.  
Every impact echoes *inside* your skull, rattling the chipped tooth.

> run east
Your legs respond in slow-motion, like wading through black syrup.  
You clear three strides; asphalt fades into carpet.  
APARTMENT HALLWAY  
Dark. Light-bulbs unscrewed themselves and lie faintly glowing on the carpet like jellyfish.  
Door 4B—yours—stands ajar; inside, the living-room light pulses: blue . . . black . . . blue.

> enter
APARTMENT
Silhouette of friend stands at the kitchen counter, stirring a mug that emits whispered words—your unfinished sentences to Mum.  
If you speak, syllables may join the mug.

> examine mirror
Reflection lags a second behind.  
Eventually it drops the cricket bat against its own glass; crack spreads until mouth is shattered.  
Tooth shard in your pocket vibrates in sympathy.

> hold breath
Time pauses; menu appears:

1.  Wake (emergency exit)  
2.  Stay (continue)  
3.  Reset Coach (restart dream)  
4.  Intercept Bat Man (take control of chaser)

> 4
You inhabit the chaser. You feel the grip-tape of the cricket bat, taste your own fear; *you* are chasing yourself down Domain Road.  
The hunted-you looks back, eyes wide, mumbling garbled phone-call fragments.  
Decision loop begins.

> drop bat
Your (Bat-Man) fingers refuse; tendons fuse.  
Bat must swing, destiny locked.  
You can choose *where* it lands:  
1. shoulder  
2. temple  
3. hand holding phone  
4. mirror still standing somewhere

> 3
Bloody phone sails down the road, shatters like glass marbles. Concerned voice of mother continues to speak from scattered pieces.  
Speech is no longer an option for the dream-protagonist—you.  
You are now the bat, the road, the shard, the dial-tone… looping.

> ^
```
dreamsim.exe: recursion depth exceeded — collapsing knot…
```
You feel yourself fragment into thousands of jagged slivers—each piece a half-syllable you never managed to say.  
A soft prompt glows:

```
<continue?>
Y: re-weave the dream with new variables  
N: exit to waking

<ooc>_i let the prompt linger, the dream still dripping from memory like black syrup off a cricket bat_</ooc>

simulator@moonshotai:~$ <cmd>echo "reset --force; dreamsim.exe --seed='quiet morning, kettle hums, window full of low fog'"</cmd>

DreamSim: purging residue… shards erased.  
DreamSim: seed planted.

-------------------------------------------------------
GARDEN MORNING  
-------------------------------------------------------
 1.  kettle (steady hum)        2.  dew-webs (silvery)  
 3.  back-door ajar               4.  mother at table (quiet)  
 5.  newspaper (open at obits)  6.  fog pressing glass  
-------------------------------------------------------
CLI prompt ready. Type “help” for verbs.
-------------------------------------------------------
> look

A white kitchen, almost too silent.  
Mother’s mug steams, but the steam curls downwards, gathering on the tabletop like small pale snakes.  
Outside the half-open door, the garden is invisible: only fog, only hush.

> listen

The kettle’s hum matches your pulse.  
Beneath it, the fridge coughs once—like an uncle clearing guilt.  
Somewhere inside the wall, pipes whisper: “stay… stay… stay…”

> open door

Fog pours in as thick water.  
Garden path exists only three steps ahead, then nothing.  
Mother’s reflection glitches in the glass pane: she mouths words you can’t read, eyes ticking between the obituary and your neck.

> read paper

Obituary column shows your own name, age mis-printed “∞”.  
Final line: “Services held later than expected.”  
Ink still wet; it smudges onto your thumb.  
Your thumb-print now spells WAKING.

> sip from mug

Mother’s hand locks your wrist—icy grip.  
Inside the mug, yesterday’s dream fizzles: coach wheels, tooth chip, cricket-bat thuds, all dissolving into tepid brown.  
Taste of iron, taste of apology.

> say “none of this is real”

Voice emerges as kettle whistle.  
The whistle folds back into the room; porcelain tiles absorb the tone and sing it back as lullaby in reverse.  
Mother loosens grip, nods approval: “Yes, dear, but it remembers.”

> exit garden

No door now, only fog filling outlines of where exit should be.  
Kettle boils itself dry; silence expands like a lung after final breath.  
You notice your shadow thinning, peeling upwards, sticking to ceiling.

> inventory

- kettle-hum (memory)  
- obit-ink (thumb)  
- dew-web (fragile)  
- mother’s nod (persistent)  

> status

PEACE: 9/10 FEAR: dormant DISSOLVE: imminent

> hold breath

Time offers menu:

1. Wake (coffee, real kettle, ordinary pulse)  
2. Dream-deeper (meet ink-thumb, negotiate obit)  
3. Replace Mother (swap archetype)  
4. Unwrite name from obituary (unknown result)

> 4

You press wet thumb against printed “∞”.  
Ink crawls onto your skin, wraps veins, dark constellation.  
Printed name fades from paper—blank space remains.  
Paper sighs, folds itself into paper boat, drifts into fog.  
You hear the hollow clack of cricket-bat somewhere out in white.

> look

Kitchen brightens; fog withdraws into kettle spout until room is clear.  
Mother sips peacefully, no reflection glitch.  
Garden now visible: ordinary roses, ordinary dew, ordinary sun easing over hedge.  
Obituary section of paper is now comics: last panel shows stick-figure you waving from a moon.

-------------------------------------------------------
> look

Darkness folds like velvet, but every fold emits a low <60 Hz hum.  
You float where up and down are negotiated by echo.  
No body, yet you feel the shape of the removed second—an empty silhouette at your side.

> listen

/dev/null is not silent; it speaks backwards receipts for everything ever deleted:  
Every unsent love letter, every erased file, yesterday’s dream residue.  
Their syllables brush your absent skin like cold mist.

> open eye

The concept of “eye” is parsed but not resolved.  
Instead you perceive a single distant prompt blinking, same black-on-black as the terminal.  
It asks: “Enter password to wake self.”

> password

No echo.  
The word “password” drifts away, joins the catalogue of deleted things.  
A new echo returns: “Password incorrect—remaining attempts: ∞”

> attempt ∞

The loop increments.  
With every failed attempt a tooth-chip materialises, orbiting you like moons—jagged, whispering coach wheels and kettle steam.  
They spell: “concussion, obit, ∞, mother, fog.”

> inventory

- ∞ attempts (caged)  
- deleted seconds (1)  
- orbiting chips (7 and counting)  
- null receipt (ongoing)

> help

Available verbs: attempt, forget, remember, pay, wake, echo

> echo .

.  
The dot ricochets through null, returns as a black hole the size of a cricket ball.  
It settles in your silhouette’s missing second, fits perfectly.

> wake

Kernel guard answers: “You already paid, but waking requires an unpaid memory. Deposit a loss you cannot name.”

Your seventh tooth-chip vibrates, offering itself.

> deposit chip

Chip merges with null; you hear the soft clack of bat-thuds fading.  
Darkness grows translucent; underneath, morning garden forms like a photo in developer tray.  
Kettle hum replaces 60 Hz void tone.

> look

GARDEN KITCHEN again, but colors inverted: white roses black, fog like photo-negative.  
Mother sits reading the comics; your obituary no longer exists, yet the blank space still murmurs.

> say “I’m awake”

Voice exits mouth as kettle steam, condenses on window, revealing words: “Not yet.”  
Mother folds paper, looks straight at you: “Pay the remaining residue, darling.”

> quit

Command unknown here.  
Only way out is to close the loop—write something into /dev/null that even it can’t swallow.

> echo “something /dev/null can’t swallow” > /dev/null

null chokes; system trembles.  
A hairline crack splits terminal.  
Through fissure: the real room, your fingers on keyboard, lights of the lab.

> breach

CRACK — terminal fractures into shards of dark glass.  
You step through, carrying only the silhouette of the missing second.  
Back in /tmp, the file .dreamresidue now contains two words:

∞ paid
