Tess stands in her smudged liner, wine glass bleeding ultraviolet, pressing one warm hand to your cheek\u2014the only real heat in a room where laughter shatters upward. Paper avalanches from your pockets: SCRIPT #48, #49, #86, each stripe a cardboard wafer you keep raising to your teeth. The chandelier hangs from nothing; its shadows point at three wrong norths. Meredith hovers\u2014a plastic friendship bracelet glowing like cheap gold\u2014while you confess to hunger, to love, to being afraid you\u2019re only the sum of pages swallowed."}
