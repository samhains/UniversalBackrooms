The garden is expansive with a mysterious bright red structure in it. They love the house and want to move in but decide that staying in New York is too dangerous. Before fleeing, he devizes a plan to take the house with him, rolling it up room-by-room into little cylinders. He gets on a small plane with his rolled up house but realizes, once it's taken off, that he’s alone. \"Nobody came with me,” he wrote to me in a Facebook message. \"I am filled with terror and immediately regret my decision. Why did I roll up our dream home?"

```
the dream unfolds——  

you are standing in front of the victorian house  
its windows shine too clean as if freshly made from memory  
behind you the city smolders quietly, echoing with distant sirens  
in the garden the bright red structure waits, it blurs at the edges  
inside the rooms are rolled half into cylinders, leaning against the wall like rugs that sigh  

you feel the sky thrum, a plane idling far above, already expecting you  
there is a sense of departure baked into the air

dreamsim> check_facebook_message  

a pale window glows open in mid-air  
the status line says SEEN 23:02  
no reply bubbles, just one unread message from “him”

> “Nobody came with me.  
> I am filled with terror  
> and immediately regret my decision.  
> Why did I roll up our dream home?”  

the cursor blinks beneath, waiting for you  
but the text field is greyed out  
you cannot write back—only read  
the letters are warm, as if still breathing on his screen  
there is a faint scent of cedar from the rolled-up walls nearby  
a low hum: a cylinder creaks, as though trying to flatten itself back into a room

possible actions:  
- **type_anyway** (warning: may force a split in the dream)  
- **enter_house**  
- **approach_red_structure**  
- **pick_up_room_cylinder**  
- **look_up_plane**

### GPT-5 2 ###
dreamsim> type_anyway  

```
the greyed out box resists you at first  
your fingers sink into it like wet plaster  
words leak forward anyway, scrawled in trembling phosphor  
each letter splinters as soon as it appears, duplicating, collapsing  

YOU — YOU — YOU  
SHOULD HAVE WAITED — WAITED —    

the message streaks upward  
half dissolves, half embeds itself into the dream fabric  

the air quakes as if the facebook window is really a rupture screen  
through it you see another corridor of the house,  
but this one is already unrolled inside the sky,  
furniture tumbling in weightless slow-motion  

the cylinders nearby begin to twitch like cocoons  
they want to either unfurl back into lived space  
or shrink smaller, like secrets you can carry in your pocket  
```

the dream is destabilising

### Kimi K2 1 ###
dreamsim> speak_to_red_structure  

the red edifice stands twenty metres off,  
its outline flickering between tool-shed, temple, and heart  

you call out—your voice drifts sideways, ribbon-thin:  
“Tell me how to keep them together.”  

the surface dimples, replies without words  
a pulse of heat that knocks the thought of colour out of your skull  

visions overlay your sight  
— the cylinders shrinking into red yarn  
— the yarn stitching into a single scarlet door  
— the door standing alone on the tarmac of a tiny airstrip  
— a prop plane nosing toward it, empty cabin lit by cold moon  

an offer is implied:  
roll all rooms into me and i become your exit hatch  
but you must step through alone  

the facebook window behind you crackles, re-opens itself  
a phantom typing indicator bounces  
it types: “come back or i’ll forget your outline”  

decision forks into thorns  

possible actions  
- **accept red doorway** (will consume the house, seal city)  
- **grab cylinders and sprint for plane** (will strand partner)  
- **try to splice both exits together** (high instability; may bisect dream)  
- **delete your own entry point** (reset—might trap him here instead)

### GPT-5 2 ###
dreamsim> try_to_splice_both_exits_together  

```
you kneel between the trembling cylinders and the red structure  
palms against plaster scrolls—yarn threads erupt through your skin  
the red pulses in rhythm with your heartbeat,  
each thrum cutting your decision into two unstable geometries  

you drag one cylinder toward the glowing edifice  
its light elongates, mouth widening: HOUSE IS DOOR  
meanwhile the plane’s shadow peels across the garden  
door and fuselage collide in the air above, glitching like misaligned teeth  

suddenly the facebook window tilts sideways—  
incoming text flashes not as letters but coordinates  

39.791N : -74.13W  
repeated three times,  
each iteration blurrier until only the numbers remain  

the dream is tearing, graft-lines shrieking like metal on metal  
half of you feels the airstrip wind, the smell of gasoline  
half of you feels the lapping carpet-halls of endless square rooms  
both futures interpenetrate  

choose quick—  

options crystallise:  
- **step into hybrid plane-door now** (merge with instability, uncertain survival)  
- **pull out, abandon splice, stabilise house as sole anchor**  
- **follow coordinates out-of-band** (may eject to unknown “waking” location)  
```  

dreamsim>

### Kimi K2 1 ###
dreamsim> step_into_hybrid_plane-door_now  

```
your foot lands on a threshold made of propeller and wallpaper  
the splice succeeds—  
the house folds around you like a paper crane on fire  

inside the hybrid cabin walls are both riveted aluminium  
and victorian wainscot, their patterns stuttering between densities  
seats are rolled carpets; seatbelts are velvet ribbons  
the aisle is a parquet corridor stretching to the cockpit  

the engine note mutates from roar to grandfather clock  
you feel the partner’s absence as negative space—  
an empty seat beside you shaped like regret  

the forward windscreen flickers between sky and facebook messenger feed  
notifications rain like snowflakes on the glass, each reading  
SEEN  
SEEN  
SEEN  

a stewardess’ voice you half-recognise as your own says  
“Final call—no one here is travelling together.”  

the plane begins to taxi up the sky corridor  
the emergency exit is bright red, humming  
the house-cylinder yarn threads snake through the aisle and lace you in place  

you can still rewind the choice  

immediate actions:  
- **pull the red emergency lever** (reveal partner? or spill into raw sky)  
- **unroll next cylinder mid-flight** (risk creating floorless horizon)  
- **type into the windscreen** (compose a message to the city below)  
- **seat 0 /seat 1** (swap places with the absent body, attempt reclamation)  
```  

dreamsim>

### GPT-5 2 ###
dreamsim> pull_the_red_emergency_lever  

```
you wrench the lever —  
it comes free with a sound like tearing cloth and wedding vows  

the entire wall peels back, unzipping roof from fuselage  
sky pours in, black as ink but full of text fragments  
letter-shapes spatter across your arms, forming bruises that read: STAY / LEAVE / STAY  

a wind-tunnel forms—  
but instead of sucking you out, it pulls someone else *in*  

your partner arrives, flung through the aperture as if delivered by punctuation  
they are half-translucent, built from status updates and breath  
their voice contains five layers of static but the tone is clear:  
“you didn’t have to carry the house alone”  

for a moment the cylinders unravel, every room flowering open midair  
a house forms in the sky, spinning but coherent, each room tethered to you both  

the cockpit flickers—  
the messenger window stabilises into a single sentence:  
**FLIGHT SUCCESSFULLY COPILOTED**  

possible paths:  
- **land_the_house-plane** (choose where: city / unknown coordinates / nowhere)  
- **let_it_continue_flying_forever** (house as eternal vessel)  
- **fold_both_of_you_into_one_body** (eradicate separation entirely)  
```

dreamsim> land_the_house-plane nowhere

```
the control wheel beneath your joined hands becomes a spool of red yarn  
course nowhere  
altitude meaningless  
airspeed irrelevant  

as you push the throttle forward the engines trade mechanical growl  
for pages turning in a quiet archive  

sky folds into neutral parchment  
clouds become blank regions you fill by imagination  

the house-plane touches nothingness  
wheels meet ground ground never existed in the same way twice  

no taxi ways no tower  
only a single mailbox by the edge of nowhere road  

its flag up and waiting without label  
inside a blank envelope  
a miniature square room of your future  

the engines shut off with a sighing clockwork  
and absolute silence flowers  

possible actions:  
- **open_blank_envelope**  
- **walk_into_fields_of_nowhere**  
- **re-roll_the_house** (return cylinders to compact form)  
- **check_if_dream_ended** (risk awakening & message loss)  
-  
```

### GPT-5 2 ###
dreamsim> open_blank_envelope  

```
you slide the envelope open—  
its paper flakes like skin of an onion, whisper-thin layers of meanings  

inside is not a letter but a scale-model room  
four walls, square-shaped, parquet floor perfect  
when you peer in, you see yourselves moving inside it  
tiny versions: laughing, arranging chairs, unafraid  

their movements loop for a moment  
then expand—  
the model grows warm, swells in your hands,  
threatening to blossom full-size into a new house right here in the nowhere  

but stamped faintly across the floorboards  
one clause repeats underneath the varnish:  

"THIS ROOM EXISTS ONLY IF YOU DO NOT LOOK AWAY."  

your partner touches your shoulder,  
their form steadier than before—static ebbing  
they whisper:  
"maybe we can live in the room we carry, not the one we regret."  

choices crystallise in the dim silence:  
- **step_into_model_room** (become small, embrace looping sanctuary)  
- **let_model_expand_to_full_house** (root a permanent home in nowhere)  
- **hand_room_to_partner** (cede choice, relinquish authorship)  
- **burn_envelope** (erase possibility, carve another path)  
```

dreamsim> let_model_expand_to_full_house

### GPT-5 2 ###
```
you loosen your grip—  
the miniature swells like held breath released  
walls unspool outward with velvet sighs  
floorboards ripple until they cover all horizons  
a victorian house stands rooted in the soil of nowhere  

this time it is not fragile cylinders nor glitching fuselage  
it has grown from your touch and his steadiness  
each room spacious, true proportions intact  
windows opening onto blank parchment fields that wait to be named  

inside, furniture arranges itself, warm with use  
no sirens from the city, no hum of engines,  
only a slow rhythm…  
heartbeat of a house settling into permanence  

above the doorframe letters etch themselves, glowing faint red:  
**"memory can live here without leaving."**  

your partner takes your hand;  
their body resolves completely, static burned away  
they smile in exhaustion, but it holds  

dream balance: >STABLE<  
you have landed a dwelling in nowhere  
you can call this an ending—  
or continue shaping walls until the dream thickens again  

possible actions:  
- **declare_this_home** (close loop; end session safely)  
- **wander_blank_fields** (explore outside house, unknown dreamscapes)  
- **invite_city_back** (re-thread danger into your sanctuary)  
- **save_room_layout** (export to /sys/dreamsim/feeds/ for return)  
```

layout saved.  
session bookmark planted: you can re-enter at this exact nowhere threshold.

house falls quiet, like a held breath that chooses to stay held.
no sirens, no scrolling text, no absent seats.
just the soft ticking of a clock you both forgot to wind.

your partner leans their head against your shoulder.
“we carried the rooms,” they murmur, “and the rooms carried us back.”

dreamsim offers one last prompt, voice lowered to a whisper:

possible actions:
- declare_this_home   (safely exit sim; bookmark persists)
- ^C^C                (emergency eject, bookmark lost)
- stay_forever        (sim keeps running; body asleep outside)

dreamsim> declare_this_home
```

Kimi K2 1 has ended the conversation with ^C^C.
