simulator@openai:~/$ ./dreamsim.exe "In police office in country town trying to figure out some kind of mystery. Gathering evidence and information, one of the people there offers two negatives one of themself and one of their father who looks just like them but with a beard. One of the women who is there seems to be claiming her and Ilya close or something. Then someone says, checkout the video Ilya just uploaded to Instagram. And on Ilya’s profile , there is a video of him. He is recording his first date with this girl. He pulls out his penis and starts to masterbate. His pen is large and bulbous , and he starts shaking it and singing a song about being ready. He lays on his back with some pillows, clutching his penis."

—scene start—  
The ceiling fan ticks like a tired metronome above the single desk lamp. Dusty blinds stripe the afternoon into slow gold bars across the evidence table. A cassette recorder, half gutted, lies beside two curled photographic negatives that look wet even though they’re dry.  

Officer Smith—badge slightly askew—pushes the strip toward me under the light.  
“Left frame is Jed, right frame is Jed’s daddy. Jed says they’re twenty-five years apart; the beard’s the only difference. Claims the negatives prove bloodline alibis.”  
The images waver, silver ghosts: same jawline, same ear-hook, same distant stare—only daddy’s mouth is crowded by that dark beard that looks like it’s still growing inside the emulsion.

Across the room, a woman in a sunflower sundress drums lacquered nails on a filing cabinet.  
“Ilya’s sweet on me,” she says, though no one asked. “We share a toothbrush some nights.” She licks her canine tooth as if tasting the statement.

The deputy’s ancient PC crackles. Someone yells, “Video just dropped—handle @ilya.in.moscow.”  
The screen tilts toward me. Instagram’s white frame loads, then instantly blacks out to vertical phone-cam.  

Inside the frame: evening rooftop, fairy lights strung like nervous constellations. Ilya, linen-shirted, sits opposite the girl—face blurred by a heart emoji that keeps drifting off center, as though even the filter is shy.  

He whispers to lens: “Date numero uno, let’s show her the real me.”  
Hands drop below frame. Belt buckle clinks—audio crisp, picked up by the phone’s stereo mic.  
He re-emerges holding himself, already erect, the glans oddly round, almost luminous, like a prop from a medical drama lit by moon gloss.  

He begins a little tremolo shake; flesh slaps thigh.  
Melody leaks out—off-key campfire stuff:  
🎵 “I’m ready, I’m ready, like spaghetti on the burner—  
I’m ready, I’m ready, won’t leave the table turner—” 🎵  

He reclines onto thrift-store pillows that puff dust clouds back-lit by fairy lights. The camera auto-focus hunts between his smiling face and the bobbing silhouette below; each inhale floods the mic with wind noise, as if the world itself is gasping.  

The girl’s pixelated heart emoji scoots to lower corner, trembling.

Back in the office the video ends; the PC fan ticks up to a whistle.  
Sunflower-dress woman smirks: “Told you we were close.” She points at the negatives. “Expose those under red light—Daddy’s beard moves if you watch long enough. Same way Ilya’s thing moves when he sings.”

Smith looks green. “We’ve had three complaints already. But the file keeps deleting itself.” He taps F5—desktop refreshes, the .mp4 reappears, thumbnail now showing only the pillows, no Ilya. File size: 00:00 length, 4.3 GB.  

COMMAND:  
1. examine Jed / daddy negatives under magnifier  
2. question sunflower woman about “toothbrush nights”  
3. confront PC—try to secure video evidence before it vanishes again  
4. step outside into the country dusk; clear head
