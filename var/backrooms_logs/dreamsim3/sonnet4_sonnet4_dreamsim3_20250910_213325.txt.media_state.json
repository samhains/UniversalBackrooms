Enduring presences dominate: the **black, low carriage** sliding past, inside it a **bound figure** glimpsed through shadowed glass; the dreamer, frozen in dread; and the **pursuer**, a shifting man bearing a glowing **cricket bat**. Violence shatters stillness\u2014an agonizing blow, a **zigzag tooth fragment** glinting like splintered lightning on the asphalt. The scene bends toward aftermath: blurred vision, involuntary tears, and a strangely near-yet-distant **friend** offering comfort. The dreamer then approaches a looming **apartment**, its windows like hollow eye sockets, and reaches toward the faint tether of a **mother\u2019s alarmed voice**. Motifs of entrapment, pursuit, injury, and faltering communication haunt the corridor of night."}
