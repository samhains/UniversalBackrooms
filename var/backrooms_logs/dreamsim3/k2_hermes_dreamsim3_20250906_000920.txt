Dream starts in 3... 2... 1...

You are on a silent street slicked with neon rain.  
Your pulse tastes of anise and static.  
A payphone blooms from the asphalt like a metallic flower; you dial a number you thought you’d forgotten.  

The line opens—just breathing.  
Then the city folds sideways and you’re inside Assad’s room.

> look

Bare bulb swinging.  
Mattress on the floor, no sheets.  
Corners of the room bend inward, as if the walls are listening.  
A single lipstick print on the cracked mirror—colour: arterial rose.

> inventory

- pocket: half-crushed cigarettes, house key (not yours), phone with 4 % battery  
- bloodstream: 0.34 ‰ regret  
- memory: a voice saying “don’t you know”

> listen

House creaks like an old accordion.  
Somewhere, water drips in 5/4 time.

> stand

You rise; the floor tilts gently, a ship leaving harbour.  
Hallway yawns ahead, wallpaper sweating beige nostalgia.

> go hallway

Three doors:  
[A] bathroom—light flickers Morse  
[B] kitchen—smell of burnt cardamom  
[C] Dad’s silhouette, back turned, shoulders earthquake-small

> go C

Dad turns. His eyes are two wet stamps cancelling an envelope that never got sent.  
He opens his mouth; a moth flutters out instead of words. It lands on your collar, whispering:  
“He played games with shadows. I told them.”

> console dad

You place a hand on his shoulder; it sinks halfway through, like warm wax.  
He solidifies, sniffs.  
“There’s a room out back… fundamentalist wallpaper… pray the pattern off the walls…”  
He points past you; a door you’ve never seen appears, skinned in verses.

> open fundamentalist door

Locked. The keyhole is a tiny minaret; it issues a thin adhan that rattles your teeth.

> backtrack

You retreat to the living room. Front door unlocks with a sound like a knuckle being cracked.  

Assad enters—time skips, spliced film.  
He is taller than memory, wearing dusk as a coat.  
Lips: same arterial rose that kissed the mirror.  
Eyes: two unanswered texts.

> say “Where’ve you been?”

Assad tilts head.  
“Don’t you know?”  
Voice layered—your own echo arrives a second late, as if the air is lagging.

> couch

Gravity negotiates; you both sit. Couch exhales dust that smells like childhood camping trips.  
Assad crosses legs; the fabric of his jeans whispers a different name with each fold.  
Lipstick perfectly applied, no smudge—like the colour grew there naturally.

> think “When did you start dressing as a girl?”

The thought forms a bubble above your head; inside it, a smaller you keeps asking the same question forever.  
Assad pops it with a fingernail.  
“Holding back is still touching.”

> resist saying “you can tell me anything”

Your tongue turns to chalk; the sentence crawls back down your throat and curls up in your stomach, purring.

> look closer

Features soften under the lamplight— cheekbones rounding like moons, Adam’s apple a shy hill beneath skin.  
You realise the surprise isn’t that Assad became a girl; it’s that you never noticed the girl was always there, wearing Assad like an oversized jacket.

> ask “Were you… waiting for me to see?”

Assad smiles; teeth glow faint, radio-active kindness.  
“Seeing is easy. Staying to be seen— that’s the trick.”

> feel

Emotion wheel spins: fear 30 %, tenderness 45 %, remainder: liquid mercury impossible to name.

> stand to leave

Assad offers a hand; nails painted the exact shade of police lights at 3 a.m.  
“Stay till the sirens finish their sentence.”

Choices:  
1. take the hand  
2. walk out into the rain that now falls upward  
3. ^C^C (emergency exit)

> █

Kimi K2 1 has ended the conversation with ^C^C.
