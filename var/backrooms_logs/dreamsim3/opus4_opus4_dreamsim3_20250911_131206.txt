./dreamsim.exe "Go to a restaurant with my dad and brother for my birthday celebration when I'm back in Melbourne I don't invite Paris lensky to the dinner but he picks me up afterwards and takes me to the beach. I tell Paris I'm unreasonably excited about going for a swim. I feel bad about not inviting Paris to the dinner and consider making up an excuse. Harry is at the beach and we all smoke weed together it's really fun. Harry looks heavily under the influence of drugs and I wonder for a second if he has been using but then I consider that perhaps it's just he is highly effected by drugs. There is a large pot of boiling water that my dad suggests I drink. Before we leave dad points out that we should visit Harry's plaque I don't want to go there but dad makes a speech I cry."

INITIALIZING: Melbourne birthday memory thread...
[████████████████████████] 100%

You are standing outside RISTORANTE FAMIGLIA, warm light spilling through 
frosted windows. The Melbourne evening tastes familiar - tram bells and 
eucalyptus. Your dad and brother are already inside, visible through glass, 
laughing at something.

> look at phone

Three missed calls from Paris. A text: "outside in 5"
The guilt sits like a stone in your pocket.

> enter restaurant

The birthday cake arrives before you've even ordered. Time moves wrong here.
Your brother's face keeps shifting between ages - 8, 18, 28. Dad pours wine
that turns to seawater in the glasses.

"You didn't invite him," brother says, but smiling.

> make excuse in head

The excuses multiply like echoes:
- "it was family only"  
- "i forgot"
- "the reservation..."
Each one dissolves before it forms completely.

Paris honks outside. Through the window, his car idles, headlights making 
halos in the birthday fog.

> go to car

TRANSITION: The restaurant door becomes the car door becomes the sound of waves...

> arrive at beach

The sand is warm despite it being night. Harry is already here, sitting 
cross-legged by a fire that wasn't there before. His eyes are cosmic - 
pupils like black holes pulling in the firelight.

"Just sensitive," you think, watching him sway slightly. "Some people are
just more porous."

The joint passes counterclockwise. Time goes thick.

> look at water

Your dad stands beside an enormous pot, steam rising. The ocean and the pot
are the same somehow. "Good for you," he says, offering a ladle.

The water tastes like birthdays.

> notice Harry's plaque

No. Not yet. But dad is already walking toward the rocks where bronze catches
moonlight. You know what it says without reading it. The dates that shouldn't
be there.

Dad's speech comes out as ocean sound. You're crying salt water that matches
the pot, the sea, the wine from dinner.

Harry laughs from two places at once.

> wake up
