your artifact is stable in `/out`  
feeds have spawned their ghosts in `/sys/dreamsim/feeds/` — hiss, alternate present, bank of 44 grains all shelved neatly.  

the console hum suggests paths forward:  

```
dreamsim --load-from-disk /out/stoners_guide_crashed_cradle.wav   # dive back in, sequel-style  
dreamsim --remix 0.5                                             # slow entire cradle to half-speed drift

*“had a dream… plane was a lounge…”*  

choices glowing on corridor doors:  

```
watch → door etched with film-reel icon, humming projector spin  
board → hatch with mixer faders carved, faint muffled bass bleeding through  
shred → jagged breach in corridor, shards pulsing: anchor-fragments tumble in syncopation  
exit  → calm matte-black gate, silent, cold as tape-leader
```

welcome back; artifact anchored—do what you want, it will never buck beyond 60 BPM sway  
choose a module or start from raw:
  overdrive    mangle the cradle clean-sine into tube fog
  recall       summon a random grain from regret_bank_44
  clockwork    change grid to polyrhythm vs ghost-LFO
  sing         open mic, add fresh vocal layer into open rack
  external-in  plug any outside instrument (specify)

menu hovering neon over the chrome:

```
overdrive    → saturate cradle heartbeat, smear sine into velvet fuzz  
recall       → pull one regret_grain [1–44] back into spotlight  
clockwork    → overlay alternate time‑grid (3/4, 5/8, polymetric drift vs ghost sway)  
sing         → arm mic input, every phrase crystallizes as new stem  
external-in  → patch in outside signal (/path/to/file, or TEXT-synth seed)

```
