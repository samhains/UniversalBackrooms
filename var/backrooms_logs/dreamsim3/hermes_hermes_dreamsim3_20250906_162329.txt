You stand in a crowded school cafeteria. Fluorescent lights hum overhead, casting a sterile glow on Formica tables and plastic trays. The air smells of pizza and adolescent sweat. 

Across from you sits the guy you just met – let's call him Alex – flanked by two friends. One of them, a lanky kid with acne and a cruel grin, starts horsing around with a bright red lunchbox. 

"Bet we can fit him inside!" he cackles, eyeing you up as his friends crack up. Alex looks uncomfortable but says nothing. 

The lunchbox comes toward you suddenly, its opening maw like some hungry creature. Your vision tightens.

simulator@nousresearch:~/$Anger flares hot in my chest. Before I can stop myself, I'm on my feet, palms slamming down on the table between us.

"Back off!" My voice shakes with intensity. "I'm not some toy for your amusement."

The laughing cuts off abruptly. Acne-face looks stunned, his grip loosening on the lunchbox. Alex's eyes go wide. The cafeteria noise seems to drop away as the space between us crackles with tension.

My heart pounds against my ribs. I don't know these people, didn't come here looking for conflict. But I'll be damned if I let anyone treat me like that.

I glare around at the other boys, daring them to make the next move. The air feels electric, like the moment before lightning strikes.

The table vibrates beneath your palms. Plastic trays rattle. The three guys stare at you in frozen surprise.

Alex is the first to recover. "Whoa, hey," he says, hands raised. "Chill, man. It was just a joke."

"You think that's funny?" You bite out. "Trying to shove someone in a box?"

Acne-face scowls, his bravado returning. "Can't take a joke much, huh?"

Your vision pulses red at the edges. The lunchbox sits mockingly on the table between you. You could grab it. Show him what it feels like. Or flip the whole table over on them.

The cafeteria seems to hold its breath. Your pulse roars in your ears. A teacher stands up from her table across the room, frowning in your direction.

What do you do?

### Hermes 405B 1 ###
simulator@nousresearch:~/$My eyes lock onto the lunchbox, then flick to Acne-face's mocking face.

"Oh, I can take a joke just fine," I say, my voice dropping to a dangerous low. "But I wonder..."

In one quick motion, I snatch up the lunchbox and thrust it toward him.

"...how YOU'D like it."

I don't wait for his reaction. Turning sharply, I stride toward the exit, tossing the lunchbox into a nearby trash bin without breaking stride.

"Jerk," I mutter under my breath.

I push through the cafeteria doors, my heart still pounding but my head held high. They can keep their stupid jokes and lunchboxes. I have better things to do.

The hallway stretches before me, rows of lockers standing like silent sentinels. I take a deep breath, the anger slowly ebbing.

Okay, maybe I overreacted a little. But still. Needed to stand up for myself.

Now, to find somewhere to cool off...

### Hermes 405B 2 ###
The hallway feels blessedly quiet after the cafeteria's din. Your footsteps echo as you walk, the anger slowly draining from your system.

>Look around

Rows of lockers stretch in both directions, interspersed with classroom doors. Fliers advertise school events on bulletin boards. 

>Examine lockers

Most are decorated with stickers, whiteboard messages, or small mirrors. One farther down has "ALEX" scrawled on it in marker.

>Go to Alex's locker

The locker is covered in band stickers and doodles. A small mirror hangs crookedly on the door.

>Look in mirror

Your own reflection stares back, eyes still bright with adrenaline. You take a deep breath, trying to release the last of the tension.

Just as you start to feel calmer, you notice something strange behind you in the mirror's reflection. The hallway seems... different somehow. Longer. Darker. And is that a figure standing at the far end?

>Turn around

You spin around, heart leaping into your throat. But the hallway appears completely normal. No figure, no strangeness. Just lockers and fluorescent lights.

>Look back at mirror

The mirror shows only your confused expression and the ordinary hallway behind you. You shake your head, rubbing your eyes. Great, now you're seeing things after that confrontation.

>Check phone

Your phone shows the time (2:13pm) but no new messages. You must have imagined the figure.

>Walk home instead

You head for the school's side exit, pushing the heavy door open. Sunshine and fresh air greet you. The tension melts away as you walk home, the lunchbox incident already feeling distant and unimportant.

By the time you reach your house, the whole thing seems almost funny. You can't believe you got so worked up over some idiot's prank. 

But you stood up for yourself, and that's what matters. The rest? Just a weird day.

> The dream ends as you step through your front door, the ordinary sounds of home washing over you. That strange figure in the mirror already half-forgotten.
