simulator@openai:~/$ ./dreamsim.exe this place is trying too hard to be cool with all these stupid logos
Now entering the CyRUSt University central hub...
The cavernous space hums with the sound of a thousand hushed conversations and whirring machines. Holographic displays flicker between course catalogs and outrageous tuition statistics. You notice:
- A bank of glowing terminals labeled "VCe Access - Free Learning Units"
- A food court where students inhale neon-colored nutrient paste
- A clique of students wearing identical silver jumpsuits
- Your friend gesturing excitedly toward the VCe terminals
- That kid from earlier, the 17-year-old who embarrassed himself earlier, lurking near a potted fern that glows with bioluminescent light

Hermes 405B 1 has ended the conversation with ^C^C.
