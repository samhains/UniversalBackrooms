simulator@anthropic:~$ ./dreamsim.exe "we are watching an episode of family guy and its about an alien that comes to earth wanting weed . His planet wants a Trillon grams and he happens to bump into a drug dealer who has the weed . the man and the alien arent that sifferent They talk about prices . 'Man you only pay 18!!' . They are relating really well . Like mans long lost friend . the alien proposes how much weed he needs and the man in disbelief accepts the offer. I consider how the man will spend and conceal the aliens trillion dollars. Sitting around with mum and their friends and dad says how the show is stupid . I remember the other day where i has been stoned at one of my parents new years or something parties at old house . I was one of the last remaining . I had weed sitting around the house and it was cool . i have a faint memory of smoking with parents but im uncertain if it happened. it was all smokey and hazy in the room . (It was like I was remembering another dream ). Weed was now a non issue with them .. they are reminiscing on the past . Dad says he really wonders where mums voice came from , mum says that I have an even more beautiful voice but I'm 'too far gone now' - I say it's fine i wouldn't want to be in a band with my friends anyway . They pull out this game they used to play in the 70s . It's this huge rusty 3 dimensional cart that snips at the end like scissors and they have to catch a little rusty metal ball . They begin plAying and having an amazing time ."
