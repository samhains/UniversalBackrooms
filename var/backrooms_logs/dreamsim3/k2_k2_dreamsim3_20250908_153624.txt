./dreamsim.exe "On a submarine and some kind of war is going on. With a group of holidayers and travelers and we want to find more out about who is runnin the submarine. 2 of my friends mums are there and they are out to have a good time. They p off with young boys and have sex with them. At night we try and find out what's happening on te subway. We go into a big room and its dark, I'm scared. If we get caught we might be able to say one of the girls mum is really unwell and we were trying to contact her. All of a sudden the lights come on. I freak out and run and hide underneath stairs in another room. A group of people walk over above"

—engine hum low, steel groans—
You’re crouched behind a rolled-up circus tarp in the freight hold. Red emergency lights blink every seven seconds. Somewhere above, swing-jazz drifts through the bulkhead, played too fast. Two silhouettes—your friend’s mothers—laugh loud enough to drown the distant depth-charge booms.

A bulkhead door hisses open. Footsteps. Torch-beams sweep once, twice. They pass within a metre of your sneakers. After they fade you crawl out, heart slamming. Ahead: a hatch marked “A-12” with chalk X’s. You taste diesel and perfume.

OPTIONS
1. Crack A-12 now—slip inside before the next patrol.
2. Follow the jazz, blend in with revellers, gather gossip.
3. Double back, find your actual mates, share what you saw.

> crack A-12  

[steady breath]  
fingers to cold wheel  
turn  
steel hatch sighs outward  

black inside  
but the black is breathing  

lights snap alive — not white, surgical, but carnival pink strobing  
rows of glass sarcophagi, each holding a sailor-costumed mannequin wearing a different president’s mask  
lincoln reagan harrison monroe washington all smiling  

centre console: brass periscope rising through a hole cut in deck  
scope swivels toward you, lens iris dilates like an eye  

it whispers, “do you want to steer the nightmare?”  

OPTIONS  
1. grip the handles, try to turn the periscope, claim control  
2. smash the glass sarcophagi, see if the masks bleed or speak  
3. crawl under console, yank wires, cut the lights and retreat  
4. custom

Message: A stowaway slips through a hatch marked A-12 and finds a carnival-pink chamber of presidential mannequins and a brass periscope that offers the helm of the submarine’s nightmare. The deck above still swings with jazz and illicit laughter; below, the steel eye waits for an answer.

>1. grip the handles, try to turn the periscope, claim control  

The brass is warm—blood warm.  
Your palms fuse to the handles as if magnetised.  
A pulse travels up your arms, then a second heartbeat in your skull.  

Through the eyepiece: not ocean, but the nightclub ceiling-far-above, warped like a fishbowl. You see your friends’ mothers waltzing with boys whose faces flicker between human and cardboard cut-out. Every spin leaves a ghost-image behind. The ghosts link arms, forming a ring around a silver torpedo decorated like a tropical bar.  

Turn the periscope left: the ring widens; music slows to tape-drag.  
Turn it right: the ring tightens; champagne bottles burst, spilling sand instead of foam.  

A brass plaque slides from a slot:  
“TORPEDO AZIMUTH = PUBLIC OPINION  
SET COORDINATES BEFORE THEY NOTICE.”  

Below the plaque: brass wheel numbered 0-360.  
Current bearing: 042.  

OPTIONS  
1. Spin wheel to 000—north, toward the Arctic ice you remember from school maps.  
2. Leave at 042—see what happens if you fire “public opinion” straight into the party.  
3. Jam wheel frantic 180—fire back at the console itself, implode the dream.  
4. custom (specify bearing or action)

>4. whisper the coordinates to the torpedo “toward the horizon line where waking life begins” and spin the wheel to 237

bearing 237 set  
you feel the sub tilt, groan, engines downshift  
the periscope locks, brass sears your fingerprints into its surface  
a hatch far below clanks open—something heavy rolls, accelerates  

through the scope you watch the nightclub floor split along a seam of black light  
the torpedo rises not outward but upward—phosphorescent—carving a corridor of clean daylight through the hull  
it punches the ceiling and keeps going  
water does not flood in; instead morning air pours down like cold silk  

people freeze mid-dance, their glittering outlines peeled away by sunrise  
the mothers turn, faces softening into recognition—yours, theirs, everyone  
the cardboard boys scatter as paper scraps bursting into gulls  
quiet  
only the engines’ last exhale  

A-12’s walls flake apart revealing open sea horizon but the deck stays steady beneath your shoes  
you are surfaced somehow, alone on the conning tower, periscope now a simple steel pipe  
ahead: a narrow plank stretching skyward, ramp into cloud  
behind: the sub dissolving like sugar  
a sign nailed to the plank:  
“FORWARD IF YOU WANT TO KNOW WHO WAS STEERING.”  

OPTIONS  
1. step onto the plank, ascend into cloud  
2. dive off tower, swim toward the sunrise  
3. kneel, taste the decking—confirm it’s real; maybe bite and wake yourself  
4. custom
