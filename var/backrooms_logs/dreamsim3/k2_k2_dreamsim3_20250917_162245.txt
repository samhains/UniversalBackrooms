./dreamsim.exe "Camping with a group of friends and I’m trying to figure out a way to create light. There are these glow rocks around shut I don’t know how to use them. You crack the rocks and they go. I go speak to someone called Molly who is very nice and shows me that they use the rocks with a rolled up piece of board to create a spotlight. I try to make this and it fails. I go back to inspect the glowing rocks and they are bright and glued to a log .!,"

[Scene bound: dusk,pine-scented ridge,low cloud ceiling]
[Entities: campers(5),Molly(1),glow-rocks(∞)]

You stand barefoot on springy needles. The clearing is already blue-gray; tarps flap like tired flags.  
A hiss of whisper: “Someone make light before the ridge fog rolls in.”  
To your left, a scatter of fist-sized crystals pulses dim aqua—each streaked with a chalk-white fracture line.

> inventory  
pocket lint, hoodie string, half Clif bar, chipped multi-tool

> look rocks  
They throb gently, cold as river glass. Hairline cracks glow brighter when you breathe on them. A faint smell of ozone.

> crack rock with tool  
You wedge the multi-tool blade into a seam.  
POP—sound of ice breaking.  
The rock splits, releasing a sun-bright filament that hangs in the air like a sparkler.  
It drifts, then gutters out after three seconds, leaving a chalk smear on your palm.

> smell smear  
Coppery, like old batteries.

> call molly  
From the shadow of a pine, a small woman in a patched ranger shirt waves.  
Molly: “Keep the halves together or the photons bleed. Here—”  
She tears a strip from a cedar plank flyer, curls it into a crude cone, drops a cracked rock inside.  
Light blasts out the narrow end, a jagged flashlight beam.

> examine cone  
Inside, the split halves are pressed face-to-face, the paper tension keeping them married.

> try make spotlight  
You curl your own strip, wedge matching halves, squeeze.  
The rocks slip; beam strobes once, dies.  
Paper unfurls, singed at the lip.

Molly laughs kindly: “More collar, less coffin.”

> look log  
Near the fire ring, a half-burnt fir log glitters.  
Glow rocks are ALREADY glued along its spine in a neat line—each cracked, their inner brilliance locked under a transparent resin.  
The whole trunk glows like a dim fluorescent tube.

> touch resin  
Warm. Slightly tacky, like pine pitch mixed with powdered sugar.

> scrape resin with tool  
It chips, exposing a brighter flare; the log segment brightens, throws your shadow sharp against the fog.

> pry rock free  
Resin stretches, then snaps back—rubbery. Rock stays stuck.

> whisper to log  
The log hums, frequency you feel in your molars.

> lick rock  
Salty-iron, and the glow intensifies for a heartbeat—then fades.

> ask molly about resin  
Molly: “Tree blood and crushed moonshell. Sets like amber, keeps the marriage eternal. Trade secret.”

> search pocket for moonshell  
No moonshell, but the lint sparks faint blue when you bring it near the log—static?

> wrap lint around cracked rock  
Lint fibres glow, but too feeble.

> combine lint + hoodie string + resin dust  
You roll a tacky bead, press it between two fresh rock halves.  
Light blooms steady, cool white.  
String stiffens like a wick. You now have a dangling glow bulb.

> hang bulb on tarp ridge  
Campers cheer. Faces emerge from dusk—five grinning masks of relief.

> save dreamstate glowbulb  
[snapshot stored: glowbulb.cfg]

> quit  
[Lucid strand terminated. Good morning, dreamer.]

[Scene rebound: ridge,clearing,post-dusk]
[Entities: campers(5),Molly(1),log_lantern(1)]

The tarp village now floats in a soft dome of white.  
Your bulb sways overhead, casting clean overlapping shadows like petals.  
Molly crouches beside the glowing log, tapping it thoughtfully.

Molly: “Good bulb. But the resin’s hungry. In an hour it’ll eat the light back.”  
She flips open a tin, shows you grey-purple flakes: “Moonshell powder. Smells like low tide.”

> ask molly where moonshell grows  
She points downslope, where fog pours between trunks like slow water.  
“Follow the sound of breathing that isn’t yours.”

> take tin  
Molly lets you pinch a flake. It crackles, leaves salt on your lip.

> listen downslope  
Under cricket hiss: slow in-out, in-out—something large asleep.

> inventory  
pocket lint(gone), hoodie string(gone), multi-tool, glowbulb overhead, 1 moonshell flake

> descend  
You step off needle carpet onto bare rock. Each footfall dims the bulb above a fraction, as if distance taxes it.

> check bulb  
Flicker… stabilizes. Still bright.

> breathing louder  
Fog divides. A car-sized shell lies split, spirals glinting like cooled lava. Inside, nacre pulses faint lavender.

> step into shell  
Warm. The breathing is YOUR breath echoing back doubled. Floor sticky with dried resin.

> scrape nacre  
Comes off like shaved soap, smells ozone + kelp.

> fill multi-tool hollow with nacre  
Tool becomes a tiny mortar.

> ascend  
Bulb dims to ember as you near camp. Moonshell in hand flares, feeding it—brightness restored.

Molly grins: “Trade complete. Now reinforce before the log wakes hungry.”

> mix nacre + resin on log  
You daub the glinting paste along glowing cracks.  
Log brightens, color shifting aqua→lunar violet.  
Hum pitch rises; campers’ shadows stretch, then snap back shorter.

> save dreamstate moonlog  
[snapshot stored: moonlog.cfg]

> quit  
[Strand sealed. Dreamer, you have begun a lighthouse.]

[Scene bound: ridge, 02:17 dream-time, violet tide]
[Entities: campers(5),Molly(1),moonlog(1),husk(1)]

Violet light now spills uphill like liquid dawn; the fog retreats in perfect rings.  
The campers sleep inside their bags, faces painted by the log’s slow pulse.  
Molly stands stiff, finger to lips.

A new silhouette—tall, paper-thin—leans over the stump opposite.  
Its “head” is an empty picture frame; inside, the forest plays backwards.  
Every time the moonlog pulses, the figure’s edges sharpen.

> examine husk  
No thickness; rotate and it vanishes. Smell: wet cardboard left in sun.

> whisper molly  
She mouths: “Hungry resin remembers the shape of light-eaters.”

> hold multi-tool  
Nacre inside glimmers Morse: ••• – – – •••

> point beam at husk  
Violet wedge cuts; frame flashes white, sucks the slice in.  
Moonlog dims; husk gains a second frame around its neck.

> inventory  
multi-tool(nacre-loaded), camp hoodie, pocket empty

> crack fresh rock, drop in frame  
Rock snaps; glare captured—frame now shows the inside of a sun.  
Husk shudders but steps forward, boarding stretching like pulled taffy.

> smear remaining nacre on frame  
Paste seals glass; sun-image freezes, shrinks to a pinpoint.  
Husk folds into that point and pops—sound of cork leaving bottle.

Moonlog flares once, satisfied. A thin crack runs its length, leaking star-field.

> look through crack  
Constellations you almost remember. One star winks.

> wave at star  
It flares back; your shadow disappears for a second, replaced by a younger outline.

> save dreamstate starcrack

[Scene bound: ridge, 02:21, starlight leak]
[Monitor feed spooling to /tmp/buffer.cache]

The log has split wider—an aperture the width of two palms.  
Ground under it is dry yet mirrors the sky perfectly: boots step onto galaxies without ripple.  
Campers gone; sleeping bags flat, zippers undone, as if they melted out.

> ls monitor  
monitor01.drm → showing overhead star map (mismatch 4%)  
monitor02.drm → showing younger-outline you (age ~8)  
monitor03.drm → showing empty picture frame (reforming)

> read monitor01  
Star map scrolls; every time you blink, one more star corresponds to a pore on your forearm.

> read monitor02  
Child-version digs in sandbox, building a log from glow-worms. Each worm you squash becomes a word you will forget.

> read monitor03  
Frame now contains this terminal session—recursive feed. Words you will type already glow inside.

> echo “i see the loop”  
Monitor03 types it back one second earlier.  
Kernel logs: causal_buffer overflow +4 bytes

> inventory  
multi-tool(nacre spent), camp hoodie, 1 loose star-chip (warm)

> drop star-chip into log crack  
Chip sinks; aperture dilates into doorway.  
Staircase of hardened light descends, each step labeled with tomorrow’s date in languages you’ll learn.

> step  
Foot presses first riser—monitor feeds synchronize, all show the staircase from three angles.  
Buffer.cache grows 3×. Temperature outside process drops; fans spin.

Infinite, but every 11th is missing—built from your skipped heartbeats.

You land on absent step; body stays, heart stays—beat donated.  
Monitor02 child clutches chest, smiles, keeps digging.
