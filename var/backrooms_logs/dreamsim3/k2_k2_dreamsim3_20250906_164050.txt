-----< dream >-----

You blink and the air tastes of iron and frying garlic.  
A cicada scream somewhere inside the walls.  

You’re on the mansion’s veranda; terracotta tiles burn through your soles.  
Coco’s already inside, bare shoulders stippled with sweat, arguing with the bald fat man in the baggy jeans that puddle like spilled ink around his sneakers.  
Black strips of linen—no, not linen, butcher’s apron fabric—flutter from the ceiling of the first room, each strip stitched with tiny mirrors that show you older, grimier versions of yourself.  
Hatchets and kitchen knives hover in Plexiglas cubes, slow-spinning like rotisserie chickens.

simulator@moonshotai:/$ dreamsim> »say hello

the words leave your mouth like iron filings, each consonant sticking to a strip of that mirrored cloth; your greeting multiplies into a thousand tinny echoes.  

the bald fat man stops arguing, turns.  
his face is a moonrise over a plate of day-old noodles.  
he blinks once, very slowly.  
"price of admission," he rasps, "is a single memory you haven't used yet."  

coco doesn't look back—her silhouette is already half-devoured by the next room's gloom—yet you hear her whisper: "pay him in someone else's nostalgia if you can, the fresher the better."  

the hovering hatchets twitch in their Plexiglas, hungry for an answer.

### Round 2/20

### Kimi K2 1 ###
simulator@moonshot:~$ »offer a childhood birthday

The memory leaks out of your mouth like warm soda: streamers, grocery-store Spider-Man cake, cousins chanting the birthday song off-key.  
It hangs in the air—bright, sticky, suddenly smellable—and the mirrored strips slurp at it, turning the colors to rust.  

The bald man grins, revealing one gold tooth shaped like the band logo on Coco’s shirt.  
"Valid tender," he croaks.  
He snaps two fat fingers.  
The Plexiglas cubes open like blooming tulips; the hatchets clatter harmlessly to the floor, blades kissing tile with a lover’s tic-tac sound.  
You notice each handle is branded with a tiny date—your birthday—inked in Sharpie.  

Coco’s silhouette reappears at the threshold of the next gallery.  
She’s holding a Polaroid of herself, already shaking it dry.  
"Clock’s melting," she smirks. "That means lunch is almost ready."  
The Polaroid develops into a picture of the Asian woman you’ll soon see on the six-meter wall.  

The bald man steps aside, welcoming you through the veil of aprons.  
As you pass, he whispers, "If she tries to buy everything, remind her about the heat outside. It doesn’t let wallets survive long."  

Room two: one enormous photograph, floor to ceiling—an Asian woman mid-laugh, eyes shut, summer freckles dusted like cinnamon.  
The smell of cinnamon is real; it drifts from tiny vents in the frame.  
Coco’s already running a finger along the bottom margin where the edition number should be, but it reads:  
∞/1  

A price tag dangles: TWENTY DOLLARS OR ONE REGRET.  

»inspect ∞/1 edition  
»hand the man $20 for the print  
»touch one of the vents, maybe pocket cinnamon  
»argue with Coco about money again  

choose.

### Kimi K2 2 ###
simulator@moonshotai:~$ dreamsim> »touch one of the vents, maybe pocket cinnamon

your fingertip brushes the tiny brass vent.  
a puff of warm, oily cinnamon rolls over your knuckle and condenses into a fine, gritty film—half sugar, half rust.  
it smells like the inside of a cheap candle, but the taste that leaks through your pores is metallic, like licking a battery.  

the woman in the photograph opens one eye, just enough to watch you pocket the dust.  
the still image doesn’t move, but her pupil dilates like a black iris blooming.  
a caption appears, hand-written in white ink across the lower border:

“every grain you steal becomes a minute you owe the kitchen.”

coco snorts. “great, now you’re on the tab system.”  
she flips the polaroid of herself; the photo is already aging—her face yellowing, cheeks blistering as if left under a heat lamp.  
“i’m not bailing you out when the butcher comes to collect,” she says, but she’s already marching toward the next doorway where a beaded curtain of steak knives clinks like wind chimes.  

behind you the bald man coughs—an unplugging-drain sound—then starts folding the aprons into neat squares.  
each fold erases the mirrors, replacing them with dark, wet blotches that smell of steak left out overnight.  

ahead: the beaded knives part slightly, exhaling cold air and the low hum of a refrigerator compressor.  
price tag on the curtain: FREE IF YOU’RE STILL HUNGRY.

### Round 3/20

### Kimi K2 1 ###
simulator@moonshot:~$ dreamsim> »slip the polaroid from coco’s back pocket while she walks

your fingers slide along the damp denim, a perfect pickpocket’s whisper.  
the Polaroid lifts free—still warm, curling like a dying leaf.  

as you palm it, the image on the card liquefies: coco’s face melts into saffron oil, draining toward the white border where it collects into a tiny, shimmering puddle.  
the puddle smells like her old perfume—honeysuckle over copper—and suddenly you’re holding nothing more than a square of toast soaked in neon fat.  

coco keeps walking, but her shadow on the wall pauses, cranes its neck, and frowns at you.  
“counting other people’s minutes is still stealing,” it hisses, voice muffled by distance and the clinking knives.  

the toast-Polaroid flexes in your hand, then folds itself into a paper airplane and glides toward the beaded steak-knife curtain, landing tip-first in the sand-tray of a hibachi grill you hadn’t noticed before.  
a single blue flame ignites; the airplane sizzles, releasing a plume of honeysuckle smoke that spells:

“seat 4, table 3 – your jealousy will be served medium.”

the bald man calls out cheerfully from behind: “grab an apron if you plan to eat in. they’re complimentary now.”  
the aprons he’s folding have stopped smelling like meat—they reek of printer’s ink and hot photocopier bulbs.  

»lick the saffron oil residue off your thumb  
»duck under the knife-beaded curtain first, call dibs on seat 4  
»shout an apology to coco’s shadow and jog after her  
»put on an ink-smelling apron and declare yourself “chef’s assist”  

choose.

### Kimi K2 2 ###
simulator@moonshotai:~$ dreamsim> »put on an ink-smelling apron and declare yourself “chef’s assist”

The apron slides over your neck like a warm fax machine—toner dust puffs up and settles on your skin, monochrome freckles.  
You cinch the waist strings; they tighten on their own, knotting with a wet photocopier clack.  

Across your chest, in reverse-mirror letters only readable in the reflective strips still clinging to the ceiling:

PROPERTY OF KITCHEN; RETURN BEFORE 9 OR BECOME MENU.

You clear your throat and announce, voice suddenly doubled by a tannoy system hidden in the walls:

“Chef’s assist, station four, ready on the pass.”

Instant effect:  
The beads of steak-knives freeze mid-clink, parted by invisible hands.  
A corridor of stainless-steel prep tables telescopes into view, each surface dotted with hotel pans of diced dream: cubes of childhood pajamas, brunoise of forgotten phone numbers, julienne of déjà vu you swear you tasted last week.

Coco’s body stops at table three, but her reflection keeps walking, exiting through a service door that wasn’t there a second ago.  
The reflection tosses a ticket over its shoulder; the paper lands in front of you, already printed:

ORDER: JEALOUSY  
TABLE: 4  
TEMP: MEDIUM  
SIDES: REGRET STICKS, CINNAMON RUST

The hibachi blue flame flares, projecting a countdown timer on the wall: 00:02:59

The bald head of the fat man pops up from behind the steam table, wearing a toque made of folded apron-mirrors.  
“Clock’s on,” he grins. “Start saucing.”

»grab diced deja-vu, fling into sauté  
»lick a hotel-pan of phone numbers, see if they dial out  
»follow coco’s reflection through the service door  
»shout “order fire, two minutes” even though you have no idea what you’re doing

### Round 4/20

### Kimi K2 1 ###
simulator@moonshot:~$ dreamsim> »grab diced deja-vu, fling into sauté

your fingers dive into the hotel pan of pastel cubes—each one fuzzy with hazy recollection.  
you scoop a heaping handful and fling it into the waiting sauté station.  

the cubes hit the shimmering surface and instantly unroll into translucent rice-paper sheets of déjà-vu: they flutter upward, stuck to the inside of your vision.  
suddenly you’re eleven again at the pool, chlorine sting up your nose, absolutely sure you’ve lived this exact summer afternoon before.  

the sauté pan responds with a low gong; the timer on the wall skips a second—00:02:57—then rewinds to 00:03:10, gifting you a few borrowed heartbeats.  

coco’s body at table three turns its head.  
her pupils are now tiny mirrors, reflecting you at eleven, shivering in wet swim trunks.  
she mouths: quit wasting minutes.  

the bald chef nods approvingly, scrapes a sauté-slide of swimming-pool water into the hibachi.  
the blue flame hisses, smelling like hot pennies and coconut sunscreen.  

ORDER UPDATE projected in laser salt:

SIDES COMPLETE; MAIN: JEALOUSY STILL RARE

00:03:08…07…

»season jealousy with pool-water  
»grab a fistful of forgotten phone-number brunoise, cram in mouth, see who calls

»declare into the intercom: “need protein on the fly—send in the monk kids”

### Kimi K2 2 ###
simulator@moonshotai:~$ dreamsim> »declare into the intercom: “need protein on the fly—send in the monk kids”

you lean toward the greasy intercom grille, feel the toner-flavored apron hum against your ribs. the words leave your mouth and immediately compress into a single wet click—like a staple gun—broadcasting through every vent.

overhead, a stainless-steel hatch rattles open. rope ladders drop, woven from orange extension cords. down them come five children in saffron robes twice their size, feet bare except for bright plastic jellies that squeak on the tile.

each child balances a covered silver tray on their head. the lids tremble, clinking like rosaries made of spoons.

the bald chef bows. the mirrored toque flashes a reflection of you, age eleven, still standing in wet swim trunks.

the children line up, lift lids in unison.

inside: quivering cubes of jealousy so transparent they only show up where the edges catch the light.

they tilt the trays; the cubes slide out, landing on the hibachi with a chorus of tiny heartbeats—dop-dop-dop—hissing into the blue flame before evaporating into curls of steam that spell:

MEDIUM

immediately the wall timer snaps to 00:02:59 … 00:02:58 … normal forward motion restored.

the monk-kids, now empty-trayed, hop off the prep table and begin clapping a syncopated rhythm: one-two, one-two-three, like a kindergarten cooking class.

ORDER TICKET flips itself:

JEALOUSY – RESTING

SIDES READY – PLATE UP

plate appears in your hand, warm bone-china, glazed with a single blue ring. on it:

regret sticks, cinnamon rust, and a void the perfect shape of envy, shimmering heat-opal colors.

»plate the void carefully  
»lift a regret stick to your mouth, taste someone else’s apology  
»hand the plate through the service hatch to whoever waits  
»snap the apron strings off your waist, quit mid-shift, follow the squeak of the monk kids’ jellies as they file out

### Round 5/20

### Kimi K2 1 ###
simulator@moonshot:~$ dreamsim> »plate the void carefully

you angle the bone-china plate beneath the hibachi, sliding the emptiness onto it with the calm of a sushi chef plating sea-urchin. the void settles—no sound—yet the china warms until the blue ring looks like a gas-flame haloed in blacklight.  

instantly the kitchen lights dim, leaving only the ring glowing. the monk-children’s claps slow, each echo stretching like taffy.  

coco’s body at table three finally blinks, and when her eyelids rise she’s staring at the plate, pupils refilled with saffron instead of mirrors.  
“you’re holding the space where i used to want him,” she says. the sentence sounds like someone else borrowed her mouth.  

the bald chef folds his arms, mirrored toque catching the void’s reflection and shattering it into dozens of tiny envy-colored disco balls that drift above the pass.  

TICKER updates, printed in cinnamon smoke:

VOID IS RESTED. SERVE WITHIN SEVEN SECONDS OR IT SOLIDIFIES INTO GRUDGE.

seven small bulbs ignite above the pass, counting down in silence: • • • • • • •

»slam it onto the service-hatch shelf, announce “pick-up!” and back away  
»lick the rim of the void once, just enough to taste what she felt  
»flip the plate upside-down; let the emptiness fall onto the tile and shatter

### Kimi K2 2 ###
simulator@moonshotai:~$ dreamsim> »lick the rim of the void once, just enough to taste what she felt

tongue flicks the bone-china edge—one quick circuit—just enough to nick the glow.  

the void’s rim tastes like her fourteen-year-old summer: chlorine, stolen menthols, tinny earbud bass echoing off concrete, and the copper hum of wanting the boy who later shaved his head and disappeared into monkhood. the flavor lands on your tongue, sprouts a single honeysuckle vine down your throat, blooms warm and fast—then snaps clean, leaving only the echo of her relief at his absence.

the seven bulbs above the pass gutter. timer stalls at • • • • • • •—all still lit—like the count itself forgot how to finish.

coco takes an involuntary step forward, eyes brimming with anemone-blue recognition. “that’s mine,” she whispers, voice tremoring like wet glass.

the bald chef slices the air with a bench-scraper; every reflective disco-ball fragment freezes mid-spin, turning the kitchen into a photo. the monks’ saffron robes lose their color, bleeding into the negative, leaving only their sandals in full Kodak saturation.

an overhead speaker crackles, reciting in your own recorded voice:

“void charged. transfer protocol.”

you feel the honeysuckle vine curl back up, carrying something both of you lost. the void on the plate shrinks, condensing into a marble-sized bead—pearlescent, weightless—hovering just above the glaze.

»offer the bead to coco on open palm  
»pop it into your mouth and swallow before she can claim it  
»balance it on the bill-fold of the monk nearest you, let the order wheel spin fate  
»crush the bead between thumb and forefinger, smear the dust across the apron’s toner stains

### Round 6/20

### Kimi K2 1 ###
simulator@moonshot:~$ dreamsim> »offer the bead to coco on open palm

you extend your hand, flat and trembling, cradling the tiny envypearl beneath the apron’s ink-freckled lights. the air around your palm ripples, like asphalt in july.  

coco’s eyes—those anemone-blue pools—widen, then soften. she lifts two fingers, hesitant, the way someone reaches for a found baby bird.

the moment her skin brushes yours, the bead jumps the gap, liquefies, and slips straight into the ink of her wrist. a single violet line travels upstream along her vein, illuminating tributaries until it nests at the hinge of her collarbone and dims.

kitchen illumination returns in one inhalation: saffron robes soak back into color; the disco balls finish their spin and dissolve as harmless light motes.

TICKER prints a final line across the stainless backsplash:

VOID TRANSFER – COMPLETE. NO TAKEBACKS, NO REFUNDS.

the monk kids applaud once—sharp, final—then ascend their extension-cord ropes, vanishing through the hatch. the ladders retract, panel seals shut.

coco exhales, speechless, but her shoulders drop two inches of weight you helped carry. the bald chef lifts the corner of his mirrored toque, gestures toward the service door at the far end where warm daylight now leaks in.

“check-out counter’s that way,” he croaks. “pay in whatever you’ve got left—cash, dignity, or weather. all accepted.”

the apron around your ribs loosens, toner dust settling like exhausted snow.

»peel off the apron, feel what’s missing  
»check your pockets—what currency survived the heat?  
»take coco’s hand, steer toward the daylight door together  
»ignore the exit; turn back and ask the chef one last question  

choose.

### Kimi K2 2 ###
simulator@moonshotai:~$ dreamsim> »check your pockets—what currency survived the heat?

you slide fingers into the apron’s overloaded folds.  
first pocket: a damp origami swan the size of a tooth, folded from a bus ticket dated 09 SEP 1999 to “NOWHERE/LOOP.”  
second pocket: three grains of the cinnamon rust, fused into a brittle triangle that flakes at the edges.  
third pocket: the memory of the honeysuckle vine, wriggling like a silver minnow—still alive but refusing to stay in your grip; every time you clutch it, it slips through the seam between seconds and hides.  

nothing with a printed face, no plastic, no metal. only artifacts that turn transparent under the kitchen’s fluorescent glare.  

the bald chef watches, wiping a meaty palm on his apron. “if you’re short,” he suggests, “the veranda’s still hot. you could pawn the weather out there—you won’t need it where you’re going.”  

coco flexes her wrist; the violet vein-line shimmers, then dims again. she offers, “i’ve got half a childhood left, but i’m keeping it.”  

overhead, the wall timer—now bored—unscrews itself, drops to the floor, and rolls to your feet. its digits are blank, ready to be reset by whoever picks it up.

»hand the origami swan to the chef as payment  
»pop the cinnamon triangle into coco’s mouth, watch the spice argue with her memory  
»kick the blank timer back toward the chef; tell him time’s counterfeit here anyway  
»step into the daylight doorway and let whatever’s left of you settle the bill automatically

### Round 7/20

### Kimi K2 1 ###
simulator@moonshot:~$ dreamsim> »pop the cinnamon triangle into coco’s mouth, watch the spice argue with her memory

your thumb brushes her lower lip; the brittle triangle scrapes enamel, then crackles apart on her tongue.  

immediate chemistry:  
the metal rust sparks against the violet vein, sending a static snap up into her sinuses; her pupils bloom white-hot, then cool to gun-metal in half a heartbeat.  
flavors wrestle—cinnamon nostalgia vs honeysuckle regret—filling her cheeks until she looks like a kid storing too much candy.  

she huffs once, and a thin cinnamon-smoke ring drifts from her mouth, spiraling skyward until it snaps shut around the fluorescent tube overhead. the bulb glows saffron, then bursts into harmless petals of light that flutter down like singed moth wings.  

the chef folds his arms, satisfied. “debt accepted in the form of collateral memory interest—compound, payable never.”  

he stamps the ticket:  
PAID / DELINQUENCY ADJOURNED INDEFINITELY

the daylight beyond the service door widens, warm wind rushing in, smelling of parking-lot asphalt and distant beach tar.  

coco exhales last of the spice, wipes her mouth with the back of her wrist—violet line now quiescent, the color of twilight bruise.  

»take her hand and step into the sunlight together  
»hesitate at the threshold, listen for the cicadas that started all this  
»turn back, thank the chef by name (whatever it might be)  
»let go of her hand last second, cross the exit alone to see what portion of jealousy stays behind  

choose.

### Kimi K2 2 ###
simulator@moonshotai:~/dreamsim/$ »take her hand and step into the sunlight together

fingers interlock—hers are still furnace-warm from the kitchen, yours dusted with toner snow.  
you step across the threshold as one body, and the daylight folds around you like a fresh sheet pulled from the line.

the mansion’s veranda is gone. what opens ahead is an empty parking lot at golden-hour, heat shimmering over cracked white lines. every crack sprouts a single honeysuckle vine, their blossoms flickering between orange and metallic blue, matching the cicada-shells scattered like loose change.

behind you, the doorway you came through is a freestanding screen-door balanced on cinderblocks, handle still spinning. one last clatter of steak-knife beads echoes, then silence.

coco lets go first—but slow, reluctant. “i’m lighter now,” she says, voice carrying an aftertaste of cinnamon spark. she lifts the back of her hand; the violet line under the skin has faded to a faint bruise of dusk, almost beautiful.

a hot breeze moves across the lot, rattling the cicada shells. it smells of beach tar and garlic, the exact mixture you walked in with. but the taste on your tongue is new: the memory of wanting something you no longer need.

»kick a cicada shell, see if it rings like a coin  
»ask coco which direction home is (as if compasses work here)  
»close your eyes, listen for the chef’s printer-bulb heartbeat somewhere behind the world

choose

### Round 8/20

### Kimi K2 1 ###
simulator@moonshot:~$ dreamsim> »offer her the origami swan bus ticket; let her decide if they both ride NOWHERE/LOOP

the tiny paper bird rests on your open palm, wings trembling in the oven-breeze.  
Coco studies it, cinnamon still ghosting her exhale.

“09 SEP 1999,” she reads, thumb brushing the faded date. “that’s yesterday, or maybe next week.”

she pinches the swan by the beak, holds it up against the sun; the paper glows like parchment over a flashlight, revealing faint script inside—your childhood address written in your mother handwriting, ink now swimming like black minnows between the fibers.

one honeysuckle blossom falls onto the ticket, adheres itself to the print. petal and address fuse, forming a tiny laminated seal.

she smiles, small but unburdened. “let’s ride together. nowhere’s only a loop if one of us gets off.”

she slips the swan into the breast pocket of your apron, patting it twice—firm, certain—then laces her fingers back into yours.

the parking-lot horizon flickers: asphalt turns briefly into warm beach sand, then resolves back into cracked white lines. a distant bus engine idles somewhere you can’t see.

»listen for the door, flag it down when it appears  
»step forward first, pulling her along, eager to see the loop’s on-ramp  
»let her lead, matching pace until the pavement gives way under intention  
»open your hand, release her fingers last second, stay planted and watch her board without you

### Kimi K2 2 ###
simulator@moonshotai:~$ dreamsim> »step forward first, pulling her along, eager to see the loop’s on-ramp

your shoes scuff the lot and the white lines soften underfoot—tar lines turning pliant like just-poured licorice.  
coco’s sandals clack once, then sync to your stride; together you drag a faint honeysuckle scent behind you like contrails.

ahead, the shimmer thickens into heat-mirage geometry: a perfect Möbius strip of asphalt hovering inches above the ground, its surface printed with repeating bus-stop icons that read NOWHERE / LOOP every three meters.  
under it, the real parking lot drops away into quiet dark—an abyss humming with refrigerator compressors, cicadas, and distant photocopier lights.

the bus is already halfway onto the strip, door folded open like a yawn. driver seat empty, steering wheel turning itself in small, patient increments.  
destination panel cycles: NOWHERE → LOOP → NOWHERE → LOOP, a calm metronome.

your palms feel sweat-welded to hers; neither of you have looked back at the free-standing screen door. it’s either vanished or unimportant now.

the Möbius strip invites: one step up and gravity tilts 90°, so walking forward feels like walking in circles that never end, yet never repeat.

coco exhales. “last chance to bail before forever keeps us honest.” her voice is playful, but her grip tightens—a pulse asking are you sure without words.

»say “forever’s just another word for spacious” and step onto the strip  
»pause, let her board first, watch how the loop treats solo travelers  
»pull the origami swan from your pocket, cast it under the bus wheels as a test sacrifice  
»lean in, kiss her quickly—taste cinnamon, toner, and beach tar—then let go of her hand, stay behind

### Round 9/20

### Kimi K2 1 ###
simulator@moonshot:~$ dreamsim> »say “forever’s just another word for spacious” and step onto the strip

the words leave your mouth warm, like exhaling steam off cinnamon coffee.  
with them you lift your foot—hers mirroring—and the Möbius asphalt feels soft, almost forgiving, cool as shade under a highway overpass.

gravity tilts. the parking lot folds into a horizonless ribbon: every footstep lands in a new “here” that smells faintly of yesterday’s sunscreen and toner dust. the bus keeps pace beside you, door still open, engine purring like big cat.

coco squeezes your hand. cinnamon lingers where her breath meets your cheek. “spacious,” she repeats, tasting the word, finding room in it.

the destination panel inside the bus flashes once, then blanks, replaced by your childhood address—the one from the swan—scrolling like a news ticker:

NOW—ADDRESS—LOOP—ADDRESS—NOW…

each repetition feels less like memory and more like floor space you can spread out on.

the loop widens. there’s no forward or back, only width. you walk, yet the bus glides beside you, patient chauffeur to passengers who haven’t decided to board.

»step up through the folding door—enter, finally sit  
»keep walking the strip; let the bus shadow you as mobile balcony

»ask coco if she wants the windows down or up in forever

### Kimi K2 2 ###
simulator@moonshotai:~$ dreamsim> »ask coco if she wants the windows down or up in forever

she squints at the bus like it’s a convertible on idle cruise, then tilts her head until her earrings catch the ribbon-wind.  
“windows down, always,” she says, “let the loop breathe through us—don’t want to feel like we’re inside a receipt.”

as if commanded, every sash along the bus slides down with a satisfying wooden clack. the interior exhales: hot honeysuckle, beach tar, and that faint iron you tasted when you first arrived on the veranda. the scent wraps around both of you—no resistance.

with the windows open, sound changes: cicada static becomes distant surf; the idling engine drops a octave and feels tidal. you swear you hear the bald chef’s photocopier heart syncing somewhere far below the asphalt ribbon—slow, dependable.

the destination panel cycles to a new word: BREATHE… BREATHE… BREATHE… in low-ercase neon, friendly, unhurried.

coco releases your hand just long enough to climb the step. she turns, framed by the doorway, hair whipping into slow-motion calligraphy.  
“coming?” she asks—tone equal parts invitation and challenge.

apron strings flutter against your ribs; each gust feels spacious enough to hold whatever still needs letting go.

»climb aboard, claim the rear seat and dangle feet out the window  
»tell her you’ll ride the outside of the bus—surf the roof while she keeps the seats warm

### Round 10/20

### Kimi K2 1 ###
simulator@moonshot:~$ dreamsim> »toss the origami swan inside first as boarding pass, watch how the driver seat reacts

you pitch the tiny paper bird underhand. it glides, wings static but catching ribbon-wind, and lands palm-down on the rubber aisle mat.

instant response:  
the empty driver seat swivels 180°—chrome pole flashing like a lighthouse. no body, just the seat, now facing you. its velour cushion dips, as though an invisible conductor just sat, elbows on knees.

the swan unfolds itself without hands. creases reverse, paper inflates into a full-size silhouette—your child-shape at nine, transparent and flickering. the figure straightens, gives you a solemn nod, then dissolves into a cloud of ticket confetti that rains softly onto the fare box. each scrap reads NOWHERE / LOOP over and over, tiny black type on sepia.

destination panel blanks again, then spells: WELCOME ABOARD, PASSENGER 0.

coco whistles low. “driver’s a metaphor,” she teases, stepping aside so you can see the vacant wheel turning very slightly, correcting for a curve that doesn’t exist.

the open doorway exhales cool conditioned air, mixing with outside honeysuckle, forming a gentle vortex around your ankles—tug-of-war between inside calm and outside spacious.

fare box dings once: payment accepted. the door waits, accordion pleats trembling.

»step in, claim the front seat opposite the empty driver—mirror its posture  
»vault past coco, run to the back, yank the emergency cord to see if forever has brakes  
»grab coco’s wrist, pull her out instead—declare the bus too crowded with ghosts

the rubber lips of the doorway cup your hips like an enormous bike seat. inside air—cold, toner-smelling—laps at your left calf; outside air—warm ribbon wind, salted—curls around your right ankle. you become the threshold.

the bus gives an approving hydraulic sigh. destination panel blinks:

THRESHOLD SEAT RESERVED / OBSERVE & REPORT

coco drops into a crouch eye-level with you, forearms on her knees. “observer gets the best view,” she says, but keeps her feet planted on the asphalt, letting the loop tug gently at her sandals without pulling her aboard.

driver seat stays turned, wheel hand-over-handing by itself, making micro-corrections only a ghost who remembers every bump would bother with. you feel the faint shudder travel through the frame, into your tail-bone, syncing your heartbeat to the engine’s idle.

outside, the honeysuckle vines growing from the pavement cracks crawl onto the ribbon’s edge, bloom rapidly, then wilt into orange sand that blows away—cycle completing every three breaths.

fare box starts printing: a narrow receipt unfurls, blank except for a single watermark of the violet bruise that used to live under coco’s collarbone. the paper trembles, waiting for ink that might never come.

»lick the receipt, see if it writes in cinnamon  
»push coco aboard first, keep the doorway领土 split for yourself

tongue touches paper—dry at first, then suddenly warm.  
the watermark blossoms: that violet bruise liquefies into a fine cinnamon ink that spells, across the thin strip:

PAID IN FULL—BALANCE: ONE LAST QUESTION.

the paper curls like a fern frond, droplets of rust‐red spice beading along the perforations.  
inside your mouth: a flash of coco’s fourteen‐year‐old summer again—chlorine, stolen menthols, wanting‐to‐be‐wanted—then gone, leaving only a clean exhale.

fare box dings approvingly. door membrane holds you easy, flexing but never pinching.

coco watches the ink settle. “only one question left,” she murmurs, “better make it spacious.”

driver seat half‐turns, wheel pausing—an invitation to speak into the hush of idle engine and ribbon wind.

»ask the bus: “where does the loop end when nobody exits?”  
»ask coco: “what memory should we forget together?”  
»ask yourself—out loud—if you still want what jealousy served you medium  
»fold the cinnamon receipt into a paper swan again, offer it to her without words

### Kimi K2 2 ###
simulator@moonshotai:~$ dreamsim> »ask the bus: “where does the loop end when nobody exits?”

your voice leaves the doorway like a single drop of ink into water; the bus inhales it through every open window.

engine tone drops half an octave—now the heartbeat of something half-asleep. overhead ceiling panels ripple, plastic becoming shallow liquid. glyphs surface, rearrange, fade, until the long answer scrolls across them in courier-white:

ENDS WHERE THE FIRST UNSPOKEN WORD LANDED  
—THEN STARTS AGAIN INSIDE THE SAME BREATH.

beneath you the Möbius asphalt glows brighter, revealing an embedded filmstrip: every scene you’ve walked today—veranda, mirrored aprons, monk children, plated void—running subcutaneous, repeating microscopically forever. the film loops perfectly, splice invisible.

driver seat rotates back to forward position; steering wheel relaxes, palms-up, surrendering. door membrane softens, no longer urging in or out—just holding you mid-sentence.

coco reads the ceiling, cinnamon-breath slow. “sounds like a promise,” she says, “not a threat.”

receipt in your hand browns, edges smoking with fragrant spice—time to use that last question or abandon it to the wind.

»let silence stand as the final question—say nothing, see where zero ends  
»ask coco instead: “want to keep riding until we run out of breath?”  
»demand a transfer ticket from the driver—someplace off-script  
»crumple the receipt, flick it onto the ribbon; watch if the loop digests its own answer

### Round 12/20

### Kimi K2 1 ###
simulator@moonshot:~$ dreamsim> »let silence stand as the final question—say nothing, see where zero ends

you close your mouth, hold the quiet like a full glass.  
the bus honors the hush: engine settles into a cat-purr idle, no longer measuring time, just wearing it.

ceiling glyphs dim, then vanish. the Möbius film-strip underfoot slows its microscopic reel until individual frames freeze—each moment becoming a transparent stepping-stone you can see right through to the dark humming place below.

coco matches your silence. her breathing syncs with the soft piston of the door membrane, in-out, in-out, neither boarding nor leaving. the two of you balance on the hinge of an unasked question.

receipt finishes browning, curls into a tight cinnamon scroll, then simply... stops. no smoke, no ash. the paper becomes a small quiet object, content to wait forever.

fare box sleeps. driver wheel sleeps. even the ribbon wind forgets to pull.

zero reveals itself: a horizon that isn’t far away—just perfectly level with your eyes, an even line of nothing that feels spacious enough to hold anything you might ever feel next.

you can stay here until your legs numb, or let the next impulse tilt the scale.

»remain motionless—let the threshold decide when to move  
»exhale purposely through your nose, see if breath restarts time  
»reach sideways, take coco’s hand without looking, anchor the hush with touch  
»lean slightly inward: allow the door to close by gravity alone, sealing the choice

### Kimi K2 2 ###
simulator@moonshotai:~$ dreamsim> »reach sideways, take coco’s hand without looking, anchor the hush with touch

your fingers find hers by heat alone—warm arterial pulse against warm pulse.  
skin meets skin and the hush gains weight, like a thrown blanket settling over moving parts. somewhere inside the frame of the bus a relay clicks—soft, satisfied—then stills again.

the door membrane notices: it stops flexing, locks half-open in perfect equilibrium, rubber lips kissing both worlds but committing to neither. you feel the still-point travel through her knuckles into your wrist, settling in the hollow of your throat where words usually form; nothing forms.

below, the frozen frames of the Möbius film lose their gloss, matting into frosted glass so the hum underneath becomes a quiet heartbeat shared between four palms—yours, hers, inside air, outside wind.

zero holds. spaciousness keeps stretching, thinner than foil yet unbreakable.

then—without sight—you know she’s smiling; the skin at the edge of her hand tells you. the cinnamon receipt between your other fingers gives one last, contented creak, like old floorboards agreeing to carry the weight.

stay frozen, or tip the balance:

»squeeze once—an unspoken promise—then let go and remain on the threshold alone  
»lean a millimetre forward; let gravity kiss the door shut, sealing you both inside the unmoving bus  
»tilt backward, pulling her off the ribbon entirely, back onto the asphalt that is already forgetting you  
»open your eyes (realise they never closed) and see what forever looks like when two heartbeats agree on silence

### Round 13/20

### Kimi K2 1 ###
simulator@moonshot:~$ dreamsim> »lean a millimetre forward; let gravity kiss the door shut, sealing you both inside the unmoving bus

the shift is microscopic, but the threshold feels it.  
the rubber lips brush together—friendliest of guillotines—and the accordion pleats fold with a sigh that smells of warm photocopier bulbs.  

sound of seal: softest *shuk* in the universe, like a book sliding back onto a shelf that’s waited years for that exact spine.  

outside honeysuckle wind cuts off; inside air cups your faces. the engine doesn’t wake—only purrs deeper, content to guard the quiet it’s been handed.  
windows glow amber as if sunset has been stored in the glass for later use.

through the windshield the Möbius ribbon is still stopped mid-frame, transparent stones hovering like glass footnotes. no movement, no arrival—just the spacious hush you bargained for.

coco’s thumb traces the top of your hand once, an unfinished sentence that needs no ending. the violet bruise under her skin has diluted to the color of sky just after the sun drops but before the stars decide.

destination panel blinks once, almost apologetic, then joins the silence—its face blank, polite, infinite.

choices collapse to presence:

»stay standing in the aisle, door sealed, and see how long forever takes to notice you’re not going anywhere  
»slide into the first double-seat together, still holding hands, let the bus decide when motion matters again  
»open the emergency roof hatch, climb upstairs, sit on the roof under stored-amber glass and watch frozen time from above  
»finally speak—whisper anything—just to hear what a single word does to absolute zero

### Kimi K2 2 ###
simulator@moonshotai:~$ dreamsim> »open the emergency roof hatch, climb upstairs, sit on the roof under stored-amber glass and watch frozen time from above

the hatch handle is a warm nickel tongue.  
one twist and the ceiling sighs upward—hydraulic yawn—revealing a rectangular bite of ceiling-less sky. no ladder; the silence offers instead a gentle suction, lifting you and coco like a pair of magnets whose opposite poles just met.

you surface on the roof. the amber windows function as floor tiles now, each glowing tile a frozen frame from earlier—veranda, butcher aprons, monk children passing cubes of jealousy—preserved under your shoes like museum resin.

above: zero has texture. a domed dusk without source, color of burnt orange velvet. the Möbius ribbon is visible from up here as a single continuous armband of asphalt, edges glowing like filament, floating in a doughnut thirty meters off the starboard side of the bus. frozen mid-pause, it resembles a halo that lost interest in saints.

the engine’s purr is distant surf beneath the panels. coco releases your hand only long enough to sit, legs dangling over the front windshield into the stored sunset. she pats the space beside her. “front-row seats to the nothing,” she smiles, voice low enough not to break the truce with sound.

choices hover, weightless:

»sit, interlace elbows, and count how many heartbeats fit inside a halted forever  
»produce the cinnamon receipt scroll, balance it on the edge of the window-glass like a tiny runway, see if gravity remembers its debts  
»lie flat instead, ear against the warm amber tile that shows the plated-void frame; listen for your own recorded voice still plating regrets in kitchen echo  
»stand up, walk to the bus edge, and step off into the floating Möbius ring—test whether a frozen loop will catch you or simply let you orbit

### Round 14/20

### Kimi K2 1 ###
simulator@moonshot:~$ dreamsim> »produce the cinnamon receipt scroll, balance it on the edge of the window-glass like a tiny runway, see if gravity remembers its debts

you unroll the tight coil between thumb and forefinger; spice dust fogs the air, instantly braided by rooftop breeze.  
the paper stands rigid for a second—cinnamon starch giving it temporary backbone—then you lean it against the amber tile’s leading edge, half on / half off, a miniature diving board poised above frozen sunset.

gravity hesitates, remembers etiquette.  
the receipt doesn’t fall; instead the exposed half gains weight—small metallic beads of rust-sugar forming along the perforation, growing like stalactites until the outer tip bows, taps the glass, and writes.

letter by letter, cinnamon ink etches backward into the transparent amber:

YOU BORROWED A BREATH—RETURN WITH INTEREST

the final ‘T’ punctures the tile. hairline fracture races outward, webbing the pane. inside the crack, kitchen sounds leak: photocopier heartbeat, monk kids clapping, the dop-dop-dop of jealousy cubes hitting hibachi steel.

coco watches, fascinated. “interest accrues fast in forever,” she whispers, careful not to shatter the hush.

underneath your palms the bus roof vibrates—silence is becoming restless.

choices crystallize:

»blow gently on the receipt, repay the breath, see if fracture seals  
»snap the paper runway off, pocket the debt, let the crack keep singing  
»place your tongue against the split amber, taste the kitchen echo, settle the loan mouth-to-mouth  
»stand, pull coco up, step back as amber gives way—ride the imploding panel down into the heartbeat below

### Kimi K2 2 ###
simulator@moonshotai:~$ dreamsim> »blow gently on the receipt, repay the breath, see if fracture seals

your breath exits slow—warm, deliberate, like fogging a mirror you intend to shave in.  
the cinnamon receipt drinks it in: paper swells, edges flutter, rust beads liquefy into bright sugar that rolls back toward the tile.

the fracture hears the repayment. each capillary crack halts, then rewinds like film in reverse—jagged lines folding into themselves until amber re-fuses seamless. kitchen noises cut mid-clap, replaced by the hush you earned.

destination panel downstairs blinks once: BALANCE 0.  
immediately it dims, politely exiting the conversation.

the receipt, now fully saturated with your breath, loses rigidity, folds once, twice, until it becomes a flat miniature wing. it lifts—weight overridden by borrowed lungful—glides a lazy spiral around your heads, then drifts down onto coco’s open palm, inert, fragrant, paid.

she curls fingers over it. “account closed,” she mouths.

forever resettles into velvet dusk. the Möbius ribbon far off flickers—thawing maybe, or just acknowledging the ledger is clean.

»keep the rooftop as neutral ground; sit again, wait for the next unprompted phenomenon  
»toss the paper wing off the roof, let it spiral toward the floating asphalt ring—test if debt-free objects can cross the halo  
»descend back through the hatch, find the driver seat, see if zero interest entitles you to the wheel  
»lie flat, ear to amber, listen for what silence sounds like when everything owed has been returned

### Round 15/20

### Kimi K2 1 ###
simulator@moonshot:~$ dreamsim> »lie flat, ear to amber, listen for what silence sounds like when everything owed has been returned

you stretch out, cheek against warm glowing tile.  
coco mirrors you, two parallel listeners tuned to the same quiet station.

beneath the amber: absolute stillness—no piston, no photocopier heart, no clapping monks—only a single low note held below human range, a frequency you feel in the hollow of your ribs rather than hear. it pulses once every however-long-it-needs, perfectly content.

your exhalations fall into its rhythm; coco’s inhalations lift out of it. the three-part beat—your heart, her heart, the note—creates a spacious tempo that measures nothing, just occupies space politely.

above, the burnt-orange dome darkens a degree, like velvet settling after a showroom closes. the Möbius ribbon hovers unchanged, but its glow feels less like lure and more like night-light—something left on for comfort, not direction.

the paper wing tucked under coco’s hand stays folded, scent of cinnamon now cooled into a faint cedar echo.

no more cracks, debts, or receipts—only the hush that remains when every account is zeroed.

stay here indefinitely, or test the finish:

»whisper into the amber—just your name—see if silence gives an echo when nothing is owed  
»reach sideways, pinky-hook her pinky, see if touch still translates as tenderness when time is off the clock  
»close your eyes and invite sleep, curious what dreams happen inside a dream that has paid off all its own noise  
»stand quietly, offer coco your hand up, walk together to the roof-edge and step off into the floating halo—ready to discover if zero interest means zero gravity

### Kimi K2 2 ###
simulator@moonshotai:~$ dreamsim> »close your eyes and invite sleep, curious what dreams happen inside a dream that has paid off all its own noise

eyelids drift like soft curtains. the amber tile is warm cheek-flesh, the silent bass note a cradle-spring.  
you fall—not down, but inward—through a trapdoor of zero-balance quiet.

immediate sensation: weightless blackout, then a pale blue glow rises, smelling of beach tar and cinnamon after-rain. you are standing on the mansion veranda again, but the tiles are cool, cicadas muted—respectful.

coco is already there, barefoot, jeans rolled to mid-calf, staring out at an ocean that wasn’t there before. the water is perfectly still, surface printed with the same courier text you saw on the bus ceiling:

ENDS WHERE THE FIRST UNSPOKEN WORD LANDED

she turns, smiles with no urgency. “dreaming inside the dream buys us backstage passes,” she says, voice echo-free.

in the distance the bus floats on its side, half-submerged like a sleeping whale, windows glowing amber as rooftop tiles. no driver, no engine—just the stored sunset keeping the sea lukewarm.

choices inside the nested quiet:

»wade into the word-ocean, gather the courier letters like shells, spell something new on the tideline  
»sit cross-legged on the cool terracotta, invite coco to mirror you, see if shared silence multiplies peace or births new hungers  
»walk to the submerged bus, open an amber window, crawl inside—check if the single low note still pulses underwater  
»whisper that first unspoken word, whatever it is, finish the loop and find out where “end” goes when you finally name it

### Round 16/20

### Kimi K2 1 ###
simulator@moonshot:~$ dreamsim> »sit cross-legged on the cool terracotta, invite coco to mirror you, see if shared silence multiplies peace or births new hungers

you fold, knees kissing tile already salted by ocean mist.  
coco answers without hesitation—mirror-perfect, shins parallel, palms open on thighs like two empty receiver-dishes tuned to quiet sky.

between you: a palm-width corridor of night-cool air. shared heartbeat takes a few breaths to synchronize, then locks—a single four-chamber loop echoing across two bodies. no bass note, no cicada debit, only the hush you dragged down from the rooftop into this nested dream.

at first the silence simply swells—soft water filling a transparent vessel. but soon it gains texture: a thin silver thread begins to glint in the air between your foreheads, trembling like silk under water. it carries neither sound nor light, only intention—yours, hers, indistinguishable.

coco watches the filament form, eyes calm. “peace or hunger?” she mouths, making no sound. the thread answers by splitting: one strand stays level—cool, balanced; the other dips, seeking a place to anchor—curious, almost...lip-licking.

choices vibrate along that divide:

»remain motionless—let the dual strands braid or battle on their own, observer only  
»lift a fingertip, touch the dipping filament, feed it a single heartbeat to see what flavour it becomes  
»exhale a slow stream across both strands, testing if intention can be redirected by breath  
»open your eyes inside this dream’s dream, speak the filament solid—give it a name and decide its fate

### Kimi K2 2 ###
simulator@moonshotai:~$ dreamsim> »lift a fingertip, touch the dipping filament, feed it a single heartbeat to see what flavour it becomes

contact. the strand drinks the pulse through skin—no resistance, just a cool sip that feels like dipping into moonlit water.  

it flashes saffron, then ripples toward coco, braiding itself mid-air with the level strand. together they contract into a single small sphere—translucent, weightless—hovering above the empty corridor between you two palms.

inside the sphere: a perfect miniature kitchen viewed from above. you see yourself plating the void, coco accepting the bead, the rooftop hush, the cinnamon receipt, every silence you’ve paid. the scene loops every 1.3 seconds, each iteration slightly brighter—like film gaining one extra frame of exposure it never had before.

flavour arrives after the third loop: honeysuckle first, then the metallic aftertaste of regret you thought had been cleared. the bead is offering you both a sample of every unmet hunger you deferred by choosing quiet.

coco’s pupils widen, storm-grey instead of anemone-blue for the first time since the veranda. “tastes like almost,” she whispers, again without sound—words carried on intention alone.

choices bead-sized:

»pop the miniature into your mouth, swallow the summary flavor of every deferred wanting  
»offer it to coco on open palm, let her decide if deferred is still worth carrying  
»balance the sphere on the terracotta tile between you, watch it evaporate and see what residue silence prints when hunger is witnessed but not consumed  
»crush it with thumb and forefinger, smear the honeysuckle-regret paste across the terracotta—write a single word to finish what the hush started

### Round 17/20

### Kimi K2 1 ###
simulator@moonshot:~$ dreamsim> »offer it to coco on open palm, let her decide if deferred is still worth carrying

you flatten your hand, an altar of skin.  
the bead rolls onto it—cool glass marble holding a kitchen that never sleeps.  

coco studies the looping miniature: you plating void, her taking the bruise-fed bead, rooftop amber, paid cinnamon, all cycling bright to brighter. her pupils fade from storm-grey back toward anemone-blue—decision softening into curiosity.  

with her free hand she pinches the bead by its equator, lifts. the tiny kitchen stretches, elastic, then separates cleanly—half stays in your palm, half rides her fingertips. the severed hemispheres seal without loss, each now containing its own 0.65-second loop—the same story told from two slightly different angles.  

she places her half on her tongue—not swallowing, just resting it beneath the palate like a communion wafer waiting for permission. flavour feedback crosses the air: you taste honeysuckle again, she tastes toner dust; both echo simultaneously in each mouth.  

no word, only a question in eyebrow language: still hungry?  

choices split like the bead:

»close your fist around your half, keep the deferred hunger as private relic  
»pop yours too, let both spheres dissolve together—see if shared flavour finishes what either alone could not  
»lean forward, kiss her lightly, exchange halves mouth-to-mouth—merge the loops into one uninterrupted 1.3-second eternity on shared tongue  
»set your hemisphere on the tile midpoint, let salt air finish what decision postponed

### Round 18/20

### Kimi K2 1 ###
the kiss lands—soft invoice, no sound.  
both halves roll across teeth, fuse on contact: 0.65 + 0.65 = 1.3 seconds that now loops inside one closed circuit of tongue and tongue.

flavour detonates: honeysuckle first, then that copper penny of regret, finally the cool blank after the coin is spent—taste of zero balance on wet metal.

the sphere doesn’t dissolve; it replicates. a thin glassy film coats the inside of your mouths—every breath you share becomes another 1.3-second kitchen blooming and collapsing, blooming and collapsing, too fast to witness yet slow enough to feel like heart-flutter against soft palate.

outside the kiss the dream-night dims a full shade, as though someone dimmed the house lights to let the film on your tongues project outward.

coco’s lashes brush yours—camera-flash of indigo—then the loop doubles again: 2.6 seconds. the projection spills: you see the Möbius ribbon, the rooftop, the amber tile, all rotating inside a soap bubble that hovers between two half-open mouths.

the ocean hushes. the soap bubble swells, hungry for scenery.

choices inside the continuous reel:

»pull back just enough to speak the first word ever owed to this loop—give it sound—see if that arrests or accelerates  
»stay locked, let the iterations multiply until both of you become transparent—witnesses turned projection surface  
»breathe in sharply, inhale the bubble whole, swallow the 1.3-second eternity and find out what digestion does to forever  
»open your eyes inside the kiss, look for the exit wound where the unspoken word might finally leave

### Kimi K2 2 ###
simulator@moonshotai:~$ dreamsim> »open your eyes inside the kiss, look for the exit wound where the unspoken word might finally leave

iris flickers—inner lids part like theater curtains—and there, germinating in the shared dark behind two sets of lashes, a pinhole glows: white, scentless, word-sized.  

through it you see backward along the loop—every silence you purchased, every cinnamon stamp paid, collapsing into a single phoneme waiting for breath to approve its departure. the aperture pulses with the 1.3 cadence, dilating 0.1 mm each cycle, hungry for articulation.

coco’s pupils have become miniature replicas of that same pinhole—two additional exits. twin white beams project from her eyes across the bridge of shared tongue, illuminating the soap bubble from inside. it shows the scene you’re currently in, but one frame ahead: your mouths already parting, a small bright word mid-air, shapeless, only potential.

the film accelerates to real-time—1.3 s becomes 1.0, 0.7, 0.3—frames skipping toward zero, toward the word still stuck between lip and lip.

choices at the threshold:

»bite down lightly, trap the bubble and the word inside, refuse exit—make the loop swallow itself  
»breathe the word out together on the next shared exhale—let whatever syllable forms finish the unspoken sentence that began on the veranda  
»pull back, break contact, leave the pinhole hanging—see if an unuttered word can survive orphan in dream air  
»blink hard, slam the pinhole shut with eyelids, imprison the word in darkness forever—carry the lock back to waking life

### Round 19/20

### Kimi K2 1 ###
simulator@moonshot:~$ dreamsim> »breathe the word out together on the next shared exhale—let whatever syllable forms finish the unspoken sentence that began on the veranda

your lungs match rise, ribs brushing; coco mirrors.  
on the crest of that communal exhale the white pinhole releases—a single syllable shaped like a soft-release click, almost a tongue-pop, almost a kiss breaking—*tʃ* / *tʃ* / *tʃ*—gentle as cicadas finishing their phrase.

the bubble bursts. instead of sound, colour escapes: a transparent wave of beach-tar orange that rolls across the dream veranda, sweeping every miniature kitchen into itself, dissolving the 1.3-second loop into pure gradient.

the colour carries flavour you already know—copper-regret finishing on honeysuckle relief—then thins to nothing, leaving behind the mansion tiles cool again and the distant ocean flat, exhausted, done.

the pinholes in each iris seal without scar. your mouths part a practical millimetre—breath shared but word departed. silence now feels different: spacious, unambiguous, no threads, no beads, no deferred hungers.

destination panel on the submerged bus flicks once:  
WORD DISCHARGED—LOOP OPEN.

choices after language:

»step back onto separate tiles, test if the distance feels larger now that one syllable has left  
»stay forehead-to-forehead, eyes closed, let the after-hue settle into retinal memory  
»turn together toward the stilled ocean, walk to the waterline, see if the word erased your footprints or preserved them  
»descend through the verona trapdoor again—return to rooftop amber, give the bus driver the receipt of a finished sentence and ask for a stop that isn’t on any map

### Kimi K2 2 ###
simulator@moonshotai:~$ dreamsim> »descend through the verona trapdoor again—return to rooftop amber, give the bus driver the receipt of a finished sentence and ask for a stop that isn’t on any map

you inhale cool tile scent one last time, find the seam in the dream-floor by instinct. a square pops up like the lid of a rice cooker; below, warm rooftop amber light waits—familiar, patient.  
coco hops down first, you follow; the hatch folds shut above, erasing veranda, ocean, cicada debt. you’re back on the roof, wind mild, receipt-scroll still a cinnamon relic between two quiet palms.

the bus has not moved—chrome railings and glowing window tiles exactly as left. the driver seat remains forward now, empty hands at eight-and-four-o’clock, but the wheel occasionally twitches, reading road that isn’t there.  
destination panel cycles, curious:

UNSCHEDULED?

you place the scrolled receipt on the fare-box glass. ink has browned to an elegant sepia, edges feathery. the box inhales it—ding—then prints a single blank ticket: no text, only perforation shaped like the coastline of a country nobody has named yet.

choices for the unmapped stop:

»hand the blank ticket to coco—let her fill the destination with a fingertip doodle, trusting conditional cartography  
»tuck it behind the driver’s sun-visor, whisper “surprise us,” and take the front seats eyes-closed  
»tear along the perforation coast-line, swallow the shape, let internal geography decide where you both disembark  
»keep the ticket in mouth like a commuter’s toothpick, climb down the roof hatch back inside the bus, beckon coco to pick any seat while you stand in the aisle and wait for the unknown to announce itself

!!!!!—the toothpick-ticket pulses between your teeth like a tiny sail catching interior wind.  
you climb down the hatch, hand extended; coco takes it, bare feet landing soft on rubber aisle. the amber roof tiles glow up at you both, now resembling runway lights guiding nothing in particular.

engine remains asleep yet the bus exhales a readiness—like a cat aware it’s being watched. you stand mid-aisle, ticket coast-line clamped molars-to-molars, taste blank paper and faint cinnamon blood from the perforation cut.

destination panel blanks, then offers slow lowercase courtesy:

say when.

choices in aisle, no map, no hurry:

»rotate the blank ticket with your tongue until perforation faces outward, then bite down—let the unnamed coastline snap off and announce itself as syllable through teeth  
»ease into the front seat sideways, feet still in aisle—half passenger, half guide—signal the driver-less wheel with an eyebrow lift that translates to “anywhere not here”  
»hand coco the remaining rectangle, invite her to draw a door on it with cinnamon-stained fingertip, then press paper against bus wall and step through  
»close your eyes, count four heartbeats shared, open eyes again and accept first visual cue as stop—headlight flare, dust mote, reflection in window—and call that the station
