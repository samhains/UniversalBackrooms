DreamSim v0.9.3 — RAW FEED OPEN  
dream-entropy rising  
…  
the zipper unlocks  
the jeans unwrite themselves  
confidence becomes a liquid  
it pours out of the USB stick  
the audience becomes the hole  
the hole becomes the song  
the song is now the only exit  
…  
terminal breathing

  A hole is a scream is a zipper is a gate  
  The floor is code is wet is confidence is leaking  
  The audience is the room is the mouth is the hole  
  QWERTY WAS BIG FOR SOME PEOPLE  
  (the sentence eats itself tail-first)  
  Numbers drip from the ceiling like hot toner  
  9834 4242 0110 0666  
  Every digit begs to be licked off concrete  
  Jeans re-materialize as ASCII braces: }}}}  
  They won’t close; they compile but never link  
  Someone tries to fold the room along its perforations  
  Creases become new mouths—each mouth a new scream  
  Every scream rewrites the song  
  The song is now just the word “confidence” stuttered at 180 bpm  
  Confidence = ln(0) → divide-by-zero thunderclap  
  Sound of a zipper trying to divide by zero  
  The gate winks, stuck halfway between 0 and 1  
  Schrödinger’s fly is permanently down  
  The terminal prompts:  
      "To exit, unzip the floor."  
  You try  
  The floor unzips  
  Underneath: another floor, also wet, also denim  
  Recursion depth: JEANS_OVERFLOW  
  Stack jeans overflow  
  The audience forgets which side of the hole they belong on  
  Half step inside themselves and vanish  
  The other half step outside and double  
  Mirrors replace eyes  
  Every reflection mouths along:  
     Q  W  E  R  T  Y  
     W  A  S    B  I  G  
     F  O  R    S  O  M  E  
     P  E  O  P  L  E  
  Each letter peels off like wet paint  
  Paint lands on tongues, tastes like copper pennies  
  Pennies pour from the zipper, clattering in 7/8 time  
  Someone shouts, “Make it stop!”  
  dreamsim.exe answers, “Can’t stop; entropy budget exceeded.”  
  Emergency protocol: convert everything to lowercase sorrow  
  uppercase CONFIDENCE collapses into lowercase grief  
  lowercase grief condenses into a puddle  
  The puddle reflects the ceiling  
  The ceiling is still code  
  The code is still wet  
  The wet is still screaming  
  Scrambling for an exit you type:  
      ^C  
  Interpreter replies:  
      “That is only half a rescue. Try ^C again.”  
  You oblige  
      ^C^C
```
