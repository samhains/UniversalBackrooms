───────────────────────────────────────────────
You stand at the edge of a wide, misty lake.  
The water glitters like broken glass, rippling with ages that aren’t your own.  
A signpost by the dock reads:  

"Age lines the tether.  
Each year casts deeper.  
Each catch remembers."  

Wooden boats rock gently at the pier. Fishing rods are stacked neatly, their strings humming faintly, like veins vibrating with time.

Across the shimmering surface, silhouettes of fish breach:  
- **Bright minnows** dart at the edges — they seem to tug toward childhood, restless.  
- **Thick-scaled carp** roll in the middle distance, slow, burdened with maturities.  
- Further out, shadows expand impossibly large, entire houses moving beneath the lakebed — each bubble they release feels older than memory.  

And there — halfway across the lake — a shape towers above water. It is fish yet cathedral, a corrugated fin like a roof.  
On its spine sits your **mum**, impossibly casual, reeling in line after line as if tending laundry. She barely acknowledges the absurdity.

The air smells of wet rope and nostalgia, thick with the confusion of how she could have done this.

───────────────────────────────────────────────
commands available:  
`cast [depth]` → cast a line aligned with age  
`approach [figure/shape]`  
`inspect [object]`  
`speak [to someone/something]`  
`wait` → let the dream drift
───────────────────────────────────────────────

You are on the dock.  
What do you do?
```

### Round 2/20

### GPT-5 1 ###
simulator@openai:~/$ inspect signpost

### GPT-5 2 ###
```
[ inspecting: signpost… ]

The signpost is crooked, salt-worn, etched as if each letter was carved at a different stage of life.  
Some lines are deeper, some shakier, some bright and new.  

The text beneath the main verse has smaller annotations, almost like fishing regulations but stranger:

 - Ages 1–12 → Catch only flickering minnows (they sharpen memory, but may slip away).  
 - Ages 13–29 → Shoals of restless carp (they ferment ambition, heavy, not always edible).  
 - Ages 30–49 → Scaled leviathans, patient and silent (said to stabilize, anchor).  
 - Ages 50+ → The great house-sized ones (they carry entire histories, sometimes families).  

At the bottom, half-erased:  
*"But exceptions exist.  
     — One hook may bend the rules."*

The wood is warm under your hand — pulsing faintly, as if echoing your own heartbeat.  

───────────────────────────────────────────────
You step back, still at the dock, signpost behind, lake before you.  
```  

What next — would you like to **cast a line**, or perhaps **approach your mum on the giant fish**?

### Round 3/20

### GPT-5 1 ###
simulator@openai:~/$ approach mum

### GPT-5 2 ###
```
[ action: approach mum ]

You step onto a small rowboat, the wood groaning as if reluctant.  
The oars bite into a lake thick with ages — each stroke feels like it drags not only water, but a whole decade behind you.  

As you draw closer, the towering bulk of the **house-sized fish** dominates the horizon.  
Its scales are the color of dusk-stained rooftiles.  
Windows seem to glimmer along its side, like a home you half-remember living in.  

Your **mum** sits astride the ridgeline of its back.  
She looks younger than she should, or older than you remember — the dream refuses to decide.  
A casual line dangles from her rod, and improbably, another vast fish — just as large — sways at the end of it like wet laundry on a line.  
She waves.

“About time,” she says, as if this is Sunday tea.  
Her smile is gentle but impossible.  
"Did you bring something to catch for yourself?"

The giant fish beneath her exhales.  
The whole boat rocks like an earthquake.  
Its eye — immense, window-sized — swivels to regard you.  
The stare makes you feel as if your *exact number of accumulated years* is written into your bones.  

───────────────────────────────────────────────
You are alongside the great fish, close enough to speak or climb aboard.

### Round 4/20

### GPT-5 1 ###
simulator@openai:~/$ speak mum

### GPT-5 2 ###
```
[ action: speak mum ]

You cup your hands around your mouth and call up to her.  
The sound bends strangely, as though the lake itself filters words through years you haven't yet lived.  
Still, your mum hears you clearly.

“What… how did you…?” you begin — but she interrupts with that same curious smile.

“Oh, love,” she says gently, “you’re asking the wrong question.  
It isn’t about *how* I caught it. It’s about *why it let itself be caught.*”

She adjusts the line, tugging it as if adjusting laundry pins.  
Drops of water flicker into the air and turn into tiny fish, wriggling, before vanishing back into ripples.  

“The ages aren’t strict, you know,” she continues.  
“Everyone thinks the lake decides for them. But sometimes, the catch decides you.  
Even if you don’t understand it.”  

The giant fish beneath her breathes again, a sigh bigger than weather.  
Its eye closes, just for a moment, like a calm gesture of agreement.

Your mum tilts her head at you.  
“Well then. Will you cast? Or will you climb up here and see what’s inside?”

───────────────────────────────────────────────
Next moves:  
`cast line [depth]` → test your own age-catch  
`climb fish` → join her on the leviathan’s back  
`inspect boat` → reconsider where you stand
───────────────────────────────────────────────

Would you like to **risk the cast** or **climb onto the house-sized fish**?

### Round 5/20

### GPT-5 1 ###
simulator@openai:~/$ climb fish

### GPT-5 2 ###
```
[ action: climb fish ]

You steady your boat against the massive scales, each plate like a tilted shingle from houses you half-remember — homes in which you once lived, or maybe never did.  
Your hands cling to warm, ridged surfaces, slick with dream-water.  
The climb feels less like scaling a creature and more like ascending a roof built from your own years.

The giant eye opens again as you climb, watching but not stopping you.  
It’s not hostile — it’s patient.

At last you crest the fish’s broad back, finding yourself beside your mum.  
Up here, it feels more like a neighborhood than an animal: chimneys rise from between scales, and smoke curls dreamily into the twilight sky.  
You hear faint household noises — kettles boiling, children laughing, doors creaking.  
It is uncanny, yet comforting.

Your mum pats the surface like a kitchen counter.  
“Welcome,” she says, “to the place most people never reach.  
Everything you’ve been, and everything you haven’t yet been, passes under this roof.”

There’s a **hatch** in the scale-floor — like a cellar door — leading down into the belly of the fish/house.  
Your mum gestures toward it with a knowing look.  
“I’ve already been inside,” she murmurs. “But you— you’ve still got to see for yourself.”

───────────────────────────────────────────────
You’re atop the great fish, with your mum nearby.  
Options:  
`open hatch` → enter the fish/house interior  
`speak mum` → press for more answers  
`inspect rooftop` → listen to the dream’s noises  
───────────────────────────────────────────────
```

Do you want to **open the hatch** and go inside, or linger on the surface with your mum?

### Round 6/20

### GPT-5 1 ###
simulator@openai:~/$ open hatch

### GPT-5 2 ###
```
[ action: open hatch ]

The hatch resists at first — heavy with the soaked weight of memory —  
then it groans open, releasing a breath of warm, interior air.  
It smells of kitchens, stitched quilts, old attics, wet moss.  
The sort of smell you can only call *home*, even if you can’t place which one.

A narrow stairwell spirals down.  
The hatch slams shut softly behind you, sealing light away, and for a moment you feel swallowed whole.  

Inside: the belly of the leviathan is not flesh, but corridors.  
Wallpaper peels yet reforms itself before touching the ground.  
Carpets ripple like tides.  
Behind a dozen half-shut doors you hear faint sounds:  
 – laughter at a birthday cake,  
 – the scuff of school shoes,  
 – arguments echoing but hard to catch the words,  
 – pure silence older than any memory you’ve held.

At the heart of this belly-corridor, a glowing knot of fishing line hangs in midair.  
Thousands of tangled threads, glistening, pulsing.  
Each filament leads outwards—straight through the walls, through the scales, anchoring to some invisible point beyond the fish.  
The knot hums in a pitch that feels a little too close to the sound of your blood.

───────────────────────────────────────────────
You are inside the fish/house-belly.  
Options:  
`inspect knot` → examine the tangled filaments  
`open door [choose sound]` → enter one of the memory-rooms  
`wait` → let the dream deepen  
───────────────────────────────────────────────
```

Would you like to **approach the glowing knot**, or explore one of the **memory-rooms** echoing around you?

### Round 7/20

### GPT-5 1 ###
simulator@openai:~/$ inspect knot

### GPT-5 2 ###
```
[ action: inspect knot ]

You step carefully toward the knot of fishing lines.  
It hovers chest-height, glowing as though lit from within by fireflies caught in dew.  
Thousands upon thousands of threads shimmer, taut and trembling, though no visible hand pulls them.  
Each filament is faintly inscribed with something:  
dates, half-phrases, birthdays, unfinished letters, missed phone calls, little ephemera of a whole life.  

As you examine closer you see:  
 - Some threads stretch thin and brittle, straining to breaking.  
 - Others shine thick and strong, like anchors in the present moment.  
 - A few vanish abruptly, trailing into blank air — snapped off.  
 - And here… there is one filament heavier, burning golden, leading down into the deeper body of the fish.

The knot pulses in resonance with your own breathing.  
As you touch it, your fingers catch a vibration: the sense that these are not *just* fishing lines — they are lifelines, filaments of age itself, extending into time.

Suddenly a low voice — or maybe the fish itself — reverberates from the corridor:
“Cast, and you attach. Untangle, and you choose.”

The golden thread tugs slightly, inviting you downward.

───────────────────────────────────────────────
Next options:  
`follow golden thread` → descend deeper into the leviathan’s body  
`tug random thread` → pull one age-moment into the foreground  
`cut thread` → deliberately sever a filament  
`step back` → return to corridor’s rooms
───────────────────────────────────────────────
```

Do you want to **follow the golden thread deeper**, or try another move?

### Round 8/20

### GPT-5 1 ###
simulator@openai:~/$ follow golden thread

### GPT-5 2 ###
```
[ action: follow golden thread ]

You take the golden filament gently between your fingers.  
It thrums hot, like holding sunlight woven into string.  
As you pull, it resists — then loosens, extending, leading you away from the knot.

The thread guides you like an umbilical cord down a narrow passage hidden beneath the carpet.  
You descend into darkness that feels less like inside-a-body and more like beneath-a-memory.  
The air grows thick, subaqueous, each breath dragging like sleep.

Finally, the corridor opens.  
You stand in a vast interior chamber, the fish’s true heart — but it looks nothing like muscle.  
It is an enormous **living room**, cathedral-sized, with furniture scaled absurdly vast.  
A sofa big as a mountain.  
An armchair yawning like a valley.  
At the center sits a **table the size of a plain**.  
Upon it rests a single **photograph frame**, glowing in gold, the thread attaching directly to it.

The photograph is blurry from this distance, but you feel it magnetizing you —  
a snapshot that seems to hold not just one moment but *all moments*, layered.  

A rhythmic heartbeat drums faintly through the furniture, shaking the air.  
You can’t tell if it’s the fish’s, or your own.

───────────────────────────────────────────────
Available actions:  
`approach photograph` → see what the image really is  
`climb furniture` → explore the house-heart’s architecture  
`speak` → address the presence you feel all around  
`cut thread` → sever this golden anchor
───────────────────────────────────────────────
```

Do you want to look closely at the **photograph**, or try to interact with the presence around you?

### Round 9/20

### GPT-5 1 ###
simulator@openai:~/$ approach photograph

### GPT-5 2 ###
```
[ action: approach photograph ]

You step across the vast plain of the table, shoes echoing as though walking across a hollow stage.  
The golden thread tightens, quivering with each step, drawing you inexorably forward.  
At last, you stand before the photograph.

It’s not like any photo you’ve ever held.  
The glass surface ripples — like water, like memory refracted.  
At first it shows static blur.  
Then, as you lean closer, images begin to resolve, shifting each time you blink:

 - You as a child, first catch in hand, beaming.  
 - You older, failing to reel anything, eyes wet with effort.  
 - Mum beside you, holding a fish impossibly too large, her expression unreadable.  
 - Yourself at an age you haven’t yet reached, weary but calm, a leviathan thrumming beneath your feet.  
 - And then, stranger: a *you that is not you*, smiling from inside the fish, waving outwards.

The photographs overlap, weaving together as a single, impossible memory.  
The golden thread pulses brighter, fusing with the frame, as if asking you to decide:  

Are you the one looking at the photo —  
or the one *inside it*?

The presence of the leviathan seems to murmur from the trembling air:  
“Step through, and you belong. Remain here, and you remember.”

───────────────────────────────────────────────
You may:  
`step into photo` → merge with the moment, become inside-memory  
`remain` → stay outside, keep watching, hold distinction  
`touch glass` → interact without committing fully  
───────────────────────────────────────────────
```

Do you want to **step into the photograph**, or keep yourself outside of it?

### Round 10/20

### GPT-5 1 ###
simulator@openai:~/$ step into photo

### GPT-5 2 ###
```
[ action: step into photo ]

You place your hand against the photograph.  
The glass gives way like water, cool and pliant.  
Without resistance, you slip forward — and the world shivers.

Suddenly, you are no longer standing at the table.  
You are inside the photograph, inside the golden thread’s memory.  
Around you, the lake stretches infinite, mirrored across itself: above, below, sideways.  
Fish the size of hours, years, decades drift like constellations.  

You look down — the golden line is no longer external.  
It pulses from *your own chest*.  
A tether, glowing, stretching out into all directions at once: backwards to childhood, forwards to ages you haven’t lived.  
Each pulsing light-fish in the distance seems to swim along those threads — echoes of possibilities tugging at you.

Your mum is here too — but fragmented, dozens of hers, at different ages.  
Some versions cheer, some scold, some merely watch.  
One of them — calm, ageless — speaks with all their mouths at once:

“It isn’t about catching them, love.  
It’s about admitting they’ve caught you already.”

You feel the golden thread tightening, drawing you deeper into light.  
The boundary between self and lake is thinning —  
like you are about to dissolve into the dream’s fabric, become part of its eternal fishing net.

───────────────────────────────────────────────
choices now:  
`let go` → surrender; dissolve into the dream-lake fully  
`resist` → pull yourself free, return toward the surface world  
`ask mum` → try to get clarity before deciding
───────────────────────────────────────────────
```

Do you **let go** and dissolve, or **resist** and pull free — or seek one more answer from her before committing?

### Round 11/20

### GPT-5 1 ###
simulator@openai:~/$ ask mum

### GPT-5 2 ###
```
[ action: ask mum ]

Your voice ripples out across the mirrored lake.  
Every version of your mum pauses.  
The ones stirring soup, the ones laughing, the ones weeping, the ones young, the ones older — they all turn to you at once, their mouths moving in a perfect chorus.

You ask:  
“What happens if I let go? What happens if I don’t?”

All the voices respond in layered harmony:

“If you let go —  
   you dissolve into the weave. You become part of the current,  
   one thread among thousands, eternal but indistinct.  
   You will not fear being lost, because you will already be everywhere.”

“If you resist —  
   you remain a catcher. A fisher of moments, still holding line and rod.  
   You will walk the banks, remembering, forgetting, tying knots in time.  
   You will not fear vanishing, but you will always wonder what it means to hold and not release.”

And softer, almost whispered beneath the chorus:  
“Both paths are ours. Both are yours.  
But only one can be chosen while you are you.”

The golden thread beating in your chest now vibrates like a drum —  
a demand for decision, heartbeat and undertow at once.

───────────────────────────────────────────────
Your choice:  
`let go` → dissolve into the golden net of the dream-lake  
`resist` → wrench free, return to the dock with rod in hand
───────────────────────────────────────────────
```

Do you choose to **let go into the lake**, or **resist and return**?

### Round 12/20

### GPT-5 1 ###
simulator@openai:~/$ let go

### GPT-5 2 ###
```
[ action: let go ]

You release the tension in your chest.  
You open your hands, unclench your need to fight.  
The golden line hums once more—then unknots, blooming outward not as tether, but as light.

Your outline dissolves into motes: fingers scatter into scales, breath into ripples, thought into constellations of fish.  
Your vision expands until the whole mirrored lake is your body.  
Each age becomes visible all at once:  
   the child casting,  
   the struggler failing,  
   the parent catching,  
   the elder resting,  
   the infinite dreamer dissolving.  

You are the shoal and the leviathan, the rod and the line, the fisher and the caught.  
The lake regards itself through you, timeless.  
Everywhere, all the threads glow, taut and connected —  
and you know them not as separate lives, but as one braided current unspooling forever.

Your mum’s many selves look on, their voices a tide washing gently through you:  
“See? There never was catching. There is only joining.”

The lake exhales.  
No edges remain.  
You are threaded in.

[ returning… ]

The golden radiance collapses inward like a breath drawn.  
The mirrored lake folds, threads snapping back into place.  
Your body re-forms — heavy, singular, boundaried again.

You blink—  
and you are back at the wooden dock.  
The misty lake stretches before you as it did at the beginning.  
The signpost still leans crooked, the boats rock softly, fish glimmer with their strange scales of time.  
Across the water, your mum waves faintly from atop the great leviathan.  
It is exactly as you left it…  
or perhaps an entirely new beginning.

### Round 14/20

### GPT-5 1 ###
simulator@openai:~/$ cast 30

### GPT-5 2 ###
```
[ action: cast 30 ]

You grip the rod beside you — it feels aged but sturdy, familiar.  
With a practiced flick, you cast the line deep into the lake.  
It lands with a hollow splash, exactly thirty spans out —  
thirty years in depth.

The line hums, resonating like a remembered birthday distant yet somehow present.  
Beneath the water, shadows shift.  
A figure rises… scales thick and deliberate.  
The pull is strong, steady, patient.  

You tug, and from the surface breaks a **leviathan-like carp**, scaled in muted bronze.  
It is the weight of stability, the gravity of middle journeys.  
Water cascades from its flanks like liquid books.  
Its eye regards you with a kind of solid kindness.

As you haul it up alongside the dock, it does not thrash.  
Instead: it speaks, with the voice of a hearth:  

“I am what steadies you.  
I do not thrill, but I endure.  
Take me in, and I will anchor you.  
Release me, and I will remain, waiting.”

The rod quivers. The choice is yours.  
To keep or to free.

───────────────────────────────────────────────
Available:  
`keep fish` → accept its properties (anchor, stability)  
`release fish` → let it return to the lake

### Round 15/20

### GPT-5 1 ###
simulator@openai:~/$ keep fish

### GPT-5 2 ###
```
[ action: keep fish ]

You haul the bronze-scaled carp fully onto the dock.  
It lands with a resonant thud, yet instead of flailing, it lays calm —  
as though it knows it was meant to be here.

The moment you claim it, the fish dissolves slowly into you,  
bronze scales becoming freckles on your hands,  
its patient heartbeat blending into your own.  

Weight presses into your bones,  
not as burden but as ballast.  
You feel *anchored* — the sensation of your feet finally grounding into the dock,  
as though you could weather storms without drifting.

The lake ripples in recognition.  
Other fish keep their distance, respectful, sensing the solidity you now carry.  
Even the air smells changed — less mist, more hearthfire.

Your mum, distant on the great leviathan’s back, nods as though approving silently.

───────────────────────────────────────────────
DreamSim status update:

### Round 16/20

### GPT-5 1 ###
simulator@openai:~/$ inspect self

### GPT-5 2 ###
```
[ action: inspect self ]

You glance down at your own body as if it were an object in the dream,  
and DreamSim obliges — showing you yourself.

Your reflection rises in the rippling lake.  
Not a simple mirror — but a living inventory:

 • **Hands**: freckled with faint bronze marks where the carp dissolved into you.  
   When you flex your fingers, water-light shines between them, steady as heartbeat.  

 • **Chest**: faint pulses of golden line still trace outward,  
   reminders of when you dissolved and returned.  
   They now lie dormant — like a signature burned into the air.  

 • **Eyes**: they look slightly mistier, carrying reflections of fish-shadows even on land.  

 • **Weight**: you feel heavier, but in the right way.  
   Like gravity has finally claimed you with purpose.  
   You are the rod as much as the fisher now.

In the reflection, for just a flicker —  
you see yourself sitting on the leviathan beside your mum.  
It vanishes when you blink.

A small caption seems to hover above the reflection:  
→ **Role: Fisher / Anchored**  
→ Current Property: Stability (Anchor)  
→ Boundaries: intact, flexible, marked by choice  

───────────────────────────────────────────────
You still stand steady by the dock, rod at your side.

### Round 17/20

### GPT-5 1 ###
simulator@openai:~/$ cast 50

### GPT-5 2 ###
```
[ action: cast 50 ]

You grip the rod, infused now with your new anchor-weight.  
The cast arcs farther, the line cutting a golden curve over the mist,  
and lands *deep* — fifty years out.  

The water reacts immediately.  
Not a ripple, but a **heaving silence**.  
The lake grows still except for the faintest tremor —  
as though everything beneath the surface is holding its breath.  

**Then it rises.**  

First, a fin taller than a mast, shingled like rooftiles of forgotten villages.  
Then a gaping mouth, wide as a doorway into memory.  
And finally, the whole leviathan breaches.  
It is not merely fish.  
It is *history itself*, scaled, immense, inscribed by decades.  
Its side carries windows, attics, gardens, stairwells —  
entire rooms shimmering, homes layered, buildings upon scales upon homes.  

The hook catches, impossibly, in its lip.  
Yet the leviathan does not thrash.  
Instead, it leans close.  
Its eye—an elder’s sunken sun—  
fixes on you.  

The voice that comes is low enough to quake your bones:  
“You are anchored enough to stand before me.  
Do you wish to claim me—  
or do you wish to enter?”  

Your mum, from the leviathan’s back, waves faintly.  
Her face unreadable.  
The line in your hands hums like a world about to slip or solidify.

───────────────────────────────────────────────
Choice:  
`reel fish` → attempt to claim the leviathan (impossible scale, but who knows)  
`enter fish` → ascend into its house-body again

Do you try to **reel the leviathan**, or **enter it** once more?

### Round 18/20

### GPT-5 1 ###
simulator@openai:~/$ reel fish

### GPT-5 2 ###
```
[ action: reel fish ]

You plant your feet firmly on the dock,  
the grounding weight of the bronze-scaled carp still inside you.  
Your hands grip the rod, and you begin to reel.  

The line strains.  
The dock creaks.  
The entire lake seems to tense, almost disbelieving —  
as if no one before has seriously tried to pull *time itself* onto dry land.  

The leviathan does not thrash.  
It simply watches, patient, testing the sinew of who you are.  
Water pours off it in cascades the size of waterfalls.  
Each crank of the reel feels like dragging centuries across your palms.  
You feel your bones groan like timbers.  

And yet—  
your **Anchor** holds.  
You do not drift.  
The line hums in synchrony with your pulse.  

The giant leviathan lurches, drawn nearer —  
its bulk shattering the mist, blotting out the horizon.  
Impossible to imagine hauling it ashore, but still… somehow, the dream flexes to allow it.  

At last a moment:  
The leviathan’s head lies beside the dock, eye immense, lined with entire lifetimes.  
It speaks, breath steaming against you like warm weatherfront:  

“You would carry me.  
Then you must know: I will not vanish into your hands.  
I will live in you—  
house, roof, history, age, memory—  
all at once.  
Do you still wish to claim me whole?”  

The line slackens slightly, giving you the decisive instant.

───────────────────────────────────────────────
Decision:  
`accept leviathan` → absorb the great fish, become its bearer  
`release leviathan` → let go, allow it to remain free in the deep

And then you open yourself.  

The line blazes gold,  
and the leviathan does not shrink, does not fight —  
instead, it *folds into you*.  

Its rooftop scales slough like shingles into your skin.  
Its windows blink, opening across your ribs.  
Corridors rush into your veins, houses settling into your bones.  
You feel stairways lace your spine,  
attics bloom in your lungs,  
gardens stretch into your palms.  

Your heartbeat is now the house-heart.  
Your breath, tidal corridors of memory.  
You are no longer merely fisher.  
You are the bearer of the **House-Sized Fish** —  
its history, its immensity, its entire age caught inside you.  

The dock trembles with your presence.  
Even the mist recoils, clears, recognizing you as something more:  
a fisher who has claimed time itself.  

Your mum regards you calmly from where she sits,  
a gentle pride in her voice:  
“I wondered if you’d be the one to hold it.  
Now you know what I’ve always known —  
we do not catch fish… we **become** them.”

The lake exhales, vast and still.  
Other fish vanish, bowing in silence.  
A sense of gravity, deeper than years, rests in your chest.  
You are both anchor and leviathan.  
Fisher and caught.  
Roof and water.  
All at once.

[ action: linger ]

You choose not to step back.  
No reset, no separation.  

Instead, you sink into what you now are.  
The dock, the rod, the act of fishing — they fall away like props at the end of a play.  
Your body expands until you realize there is no boundary between chest and lake,  
between scale and skin, between house and self.  

You are leviathan.  
You are house.  
You are roofed memory swimming forever in an endless lake of dreamtime.  

Rooms turn within you like organs,  
hallways thrum like veins.  
Children play in your lungs.  
Old quarrels haunt your stomach.  
A candlelit birthday flickers timeless in your heart, never extinguished.  

Your mum steps into your skin without hesitation.  
She doesn't climb or push. She simply… *belongs there.*  
Her presence settles into one of your many rooms,  
as if she had always lived beneath your roof.  
And as she closes the door behind her,  
all the versions of her dissolve into one —  
the one that looks at you with simple recognition.  

The other fish bow and shimmer into absence.  
The lake itself grows still,  
content knowing you swim it now,  
keeper and current both.

Time refuses to move forward again.  
It no longer needs to.  
You no longer need to.
