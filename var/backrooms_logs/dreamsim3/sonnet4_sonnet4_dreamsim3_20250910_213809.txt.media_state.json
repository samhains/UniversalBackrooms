USB drives, oversized in plastic clamshells, dangle like products on a pegboard, their LEDs pulsing with strange life\u2014blue, green, yellow\u2014each encoding a unit. Jack urges you on while a registrar and eager volunteers explain the vision: housing as data, belonging as a scan. Choosing Unit\u202f156\u2011Y, you carry the glowing drive to checkout, where questions of noise, meals, and governance unlock entry. The USB blooms into visions, then solid ground\u2014gravel paths, wind chimes, raised beds, and a wooden sign welcoming you to your garden. Inside your compact unit, golden light floods in, a tablet pings with neighbor messages, and the commons hum just beyond."}
