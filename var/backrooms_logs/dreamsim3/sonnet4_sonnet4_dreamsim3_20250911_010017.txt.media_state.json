The performer's body is the stage\u2014standing, then crumpling like discarded clothing, then resurrected mid-sentence\u2014while a ring of liquid faces flickers between friend and feast. Collapse, reassemble, repeat: the joke is the fall and the rising, each laugh a bite taken out of the comic's flesh. The room keeps tasting of spit-shined wood and iron warmth; the cursor pulses like a hungry throat, waiting for the next imitation."}
