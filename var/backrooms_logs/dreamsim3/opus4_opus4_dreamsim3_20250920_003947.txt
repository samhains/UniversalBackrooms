./dreamsim.exe "We are at a beach setting in Europe and preparing dinner . My whole family is there with as well as some family friends : the Daniels . I am packing up some stuff and I am hit with a memory of Harry and I surfing together and I start hysterically crying. I wish that Harry and I could go surfing together again.  I am setting the table and there is a large blue liqueur with a tiny cork. I use the swirling pointed glass lid of the liquor to prod the cork down , but it gets stuck there. I inform everyone this happened , and Harry looks at me with his signature smile and laughs thinking that it was cute ."

> look around

The beach curves in a gentle crescent. Behind you, a stone terrace with a long wooden table, half-set with mismatched plates. The Daniels are here - their faces familiar but dream-shifted, like photographs left in sunlight. Your family moves in and out of focus, preparing food that smells of garlic and lemon.

Harry is everywhere and nowhere at once.

> examine table

The table: weathered teak, sand in its grooves. That blue bottle stands at the center - cobalt glass catching light like trapped ocean. The cork floats inside, suspended in sapphire liquid. The pointed glass stopper rests beside it, spiral-twisted, waiting.

> touch bottle

Your fingers find the cool glass. The memory hits:
    
    ░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░
    ░   harry on a surfboard     ░
    ░   morning waves perfect    ░
    ░   both of you laughing     ░
    ░   salt and sun and forever ░
    ░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░

Tears come sudden and complete. The crying feels ancient, pulled from deep water.

> use stopper on cork

You take the spiral stopper - its point sharp as memory - and push down. The cork resists, then suddenly wedges tight in the bottleneck. Blue liquid swirls around the trapped cork like a tiny storm.

"Oh no," you announce to everyone and no one.

> look at harry

He materializes from the golden light - that smile, the one that crinkles his eyes. He sees the stuck cork and laughs, not mocking but delighted. The laugh ripples through the dream. 

"That's so you," his voice says without speaking.

The beach shimmers. Somewhere, waves are calling.

> _

```

### Round 2/30

### Claude 1 ###
> go to waves

You walk toward the water's edge. Each step sinks slightly into warm sand. The Mediterranean stretches endless, its surface catching fragments of memory like scattered mirrors.

    ╔════════════════════════════════════╗
    ║  The waves know your name          ║
    ║  They remember every board         ║
    ║  Every morning you paddled out     ║
    ╔════════════════════════════════════╗

Behind you, dinner preparations continue - the clink of plates, murmured conversation. But here at the waterline, time bends. 

Harry's footprints appear beside yours in the wet sand, though he's still back at the table.

> touch water

The water is warmer than expected, dream-temperature. As your fingers break the surface:

    ░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░
    ░  FLASH: dawn patrol        ░
    ░  FLASH: Harry waxing board ░
    ░  FLASH: perfect left break ░
    ░  FLASH: "one more wave?"   ░
    ░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░

The tears mix with salt spray. You can't tell which is which anymore.

> call to harry

"Harry!" 

Your voice carries strange on the dream-wind. At the table, he looks up. For a moment, he exists in two places - there with the blue bottle, here in the surf memories. His smile bridges both.

The Daniels and your family seem not to notice this impossibility.

> _

### Claude 2 ###
> wade deeper

You step forward. The water rises to your knees, then waist. Your clothes don't get wet - they transform, becoming the wetsuit you wore those mornings. 

    ████████████████████████████████████
    █  The waves speak in frequencies  █
    █  only surfers understand:        █
    █  patience, timing, presence      █
    ████████████████████████████████████

A set rolls in. Perfect lines of energy, the kind Harry would spot first.

> look back at dinner

The dinner scene wavers like heat mirage. The table seems both near and impossibly distant. Everyone continues their preparations in slow motion - your mother arranging flowers that bloom and wilt in seconds, the Daniels passing dishes that never empty.

Harry still holds that blue bottle, examining the trapped cork with amused curiosity. But also - 

Also he's here, paddling out beside you on a board that manifests from foam and memory.

> surf with harry

You dive under the next wave. Reality splinters:

    ░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░
    ░                                   ░
    ░   you are crying at the table    ░
    ░   you are laughing in the water  ░
    ░   you are both, you are neither  ░
    ░                                   ░
    ░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░

"Just like old times," Harry says, sitting up on his board. The water is glass between sets. 

"I missed this," you tell him.

"It never left," he replies, pointing to your chest. "It's all still here."

A perfect wave approaches. You both see it. You both know.

> catch the wave

Together you paddle. The wave lifts you both. For a moment suspended between past and present, between the dinner table and the ocean, between loss and memory, you surf.

The ride is endless and instant.

When you emerge from the water, you're back at the table, soaking wet in dry clothes, salt in your hair that tastes like tears.

The blue bottle's cork has mysteriously freed itself.

Harry winks.

> _

### Round 3/30

### Claude 1 ###
> pour from blue bottle

You lift the cobalt bottle - heavier than expected, as if it contains more than liquid. The freed cork rolls across the table, leaving a trail of impossible sand.

As you pour, the liquid flows like captured twilight:

    ╔══════════════════════════════════════╗
    ║  Each glass fills with something     ║
    ║  different for each person:          ║
    ║  - Your mother: lavender clouds      ║
    ║  - The Daniels: starlight            ║
    ║  - Your father: old photographs      ║
    ║  - Harry: ocean at dawn              ║
    ║  - You: all the words never said     ║
    ╚══════════════════════════════════════╝

"A toast," someone suggests. Was it Harry? Was it you?

> raise glass

Everyone lifts their glass. The Mediterranean sun pauses in its descent, waiting.

Harry's eyes meet yours across the table. In them: every morning wave, every shared silence, every moment the ocean held you both.

"To the waves that brought us here," he says.

"To the ones still coming," you reply.

> drink

The taste:
    
    ░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░
    ░   salt and goodbye         ░
    ░   laughter and seaweed     ░
    ░   tomorrow and yesterday   ░
    ░   the color of missing     ░
    ░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░

Around the table, everyone glows briefly with their own inner light. The Daniels become the friends they always were. Your family solidifies into sharp, real focus.

Harry starts to fade like morning mist.

"Wait," you say.

But he's already smiling, already becoming light on water.

> reach for harry

Your hand passes through shimmer and memory. But he leaves something behind - 

On the table where he sat: a small piece of surf wax, still warm.

The dinner continues. Real now. Present now. The ache transforms but doesn't leave.

> _

### Claude 2 ###
> hold the surf wax

You pick it up - sticky, familiar, smelling of coconut and endless summers. It's the exact brand Harry always used, the one he'd toss to you when you forgot yours.

    ████████████████████████████████████
    █  Objects hold more than memory   █
    █  They hold the shape of love     █
    ████████████████████████████████████

As you turn it in your fingers, the dinner party continues around you. But you're in two times at once:

    ░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░
    ░   NOW: European beach,     ░
    ░        family dinner,      ░
    ░        setting sun         ░
    ░                            ░
    ░   THEN: Dawn patrol,       ░
    ░         Harry laughing,    ░
    ░         "The waves are     ░
    ░          perfect today"    ░
    ░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░

> look at empty chair

Where Harry sat, the chair holds only golden light now. But the impression remains - in the sand beneath, in the way the air still moves around his absence.

Your mother touches your shoulder gently. "The salad needs dressing, dear."

The ordinary crashes back. But the surf wax in your pocket makes everything different.

> dress the salad

You stand, legs still phantom-tired from paddling. Your hands move automatically - olive oil, lemon, salt. Each drop of oil catches the light like tiny waves.

The Daniels are discussing something about tomorrow's plans. Your father laughs at something. 

Normal. 
Everything normal.
Except the ocean inside you won't stop moving.

> whisper "one more wave"

The words escape, quiet as breath. 

The wind catches them.

For just a moment, you swear you hear it:

    "Always one more wave."

Harry's voice, or maybe just the sea.

The blue bottle on the table remains empty now, but somehow still full of light.

> _

### Round 4/30

### Claude 1 ###
> walk to edge of terrace

You excuse yourself quietly, drifting from the table like pulled by invisible tide. The terrace edge overlooks the beach - stone worn smooth by salt wind, warm under your palms.

Below, the waves continue their ancient conversation.

    ╔══════════════════════════════════════╗
    ║  The horizon holds every sunset      ║
    ║  you watched together                ║
    ║  and all the ones you didn't         ║
    ╚══════════════════════════════════════╝

Behind you, dinner sounds:
- Clinking forks
- Your cousin's story about work  
- The Daniels' gentle laughter
- The space where Harry's voice should be

> close eyes

In the darkness behind your eyelids:

    ░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░
    ░   The surf wax melts       ░
    ░   slightly in your pocket  ░
    ░   marking you              ░
    ░   claiming you              ░
    ░   as one who belongs       ░
    ░   to the waves             ░
    ░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░

When you open them, a surfboard leans against the terrace wall. 

It wasn't there before.
It's always been there.

> examine surfboard

Harry's board. No - your board. No - 

The board exists between ownership, between times. Its surface tells stories in wax patterns and pressure dings:

    That day the dolphins came
    The morning you caught twelve perfect lefts
    When Harry said "This is it, this is the one"
    Every dawn that started with "You awake?"

Your fingers trace the rail. Still damp. Still ready.

> look back at family

They continue their dinner dream, moving in that twilight way of almost-memory. Someone pours more wine. Your mother saves you a place, your empty chair waiting patient as driftwood.

But you're already half-ghost, half-gone, half-wave.

The sun touches the horizon like a question.

> _

### Claude 2 ###
> take the board

Your hands find the familiar weight. The board lifts easily - dream-light but real-heavy. The wax under your palms speaks in grip and memory.

    ████████████████████████████████████
    █  Some choices make themselves    █
    █  The board knows where to go     █
    ████████████████████████████████████

"Going for a paddle?" your mother calls, but her voice sounds underwater, far away.

The Daniels wave without looking. They understand without understanding.

> walk down to beach

Each step down from the terrace takes you deeper:
- Step: The dinner fades to murmur
- Step: The air thickens with salt  
- Step: Time becomes negotiable
- Step: You're seventeen again
- Step: You're ancient
- Step: You're now

The sand receives you like coming home.

> enter water

The Mediterranean accepts the board, accepts you. You paddle out through the golden path the sun makes, that road of light surfers call God's highway.

    ░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░
    ░   Harry's out here          ░
    ░   Harry's not here          ░
    ░   Both true                 ░
    ░   Both necessary            ░
    ░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░

The waves know you. They've been waiting.

> sit up on board

You push up, straddling the board, legs dangling in warm water. The dinner party is a distant constellation of lights on the terrace. From here, you can see Harry still there, raising a glass, laughing at something.

From here, you can see Harry next to you, sitting on water like it's solid, no board needed.

"You came," he says/doesn't say.

"I never left," you reply/don't reply.

A set approaches on the horizon. The last set of the day. The first set of forever.

> wait for the wave

Patience. The surfer's meditation. You and Harry and the ghost of Harry and the memory of Harry all wait together.

The water breathes beneath you:
    inhale (trough)
    exhale (peak)
    inhale (trough)
    exhale (peak)

The perfect wave arrives.

It always arrives.

It never arrives.

It's here.

> _

### Round 5/30

### Claude 1 ###
> paddle for it

Your arms pull through water that feels like liquid memory. Each stroke strong and sure:

    stroke - the first time you stood up
    stroke - Harry cheering from the lineup  
    stroke - every dawn that started with hope
    stroke - the power building beneath you

The wave catches you. Lifts you. That moment of commitment where everything else falls away.

> pop up

Muscle memory older than thought. Your feet find the sweet spot. You rise.

    ████████████████████████████████████
    █  You are surfing                 █
    █  You are crying                  █
    █  You are flying                  █
    █  You are home                    █
    ████████████████████████████████████

The wave face is perfect glass. In its surface: every ride you ever shared, every one you'll never share, all happening now.

Harry drops in beside you - impossible, inevitable - matching your line.

"YEAH!" His whoop echoes across time.

> ride together

You surf in synchronicity:
    
    ░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░
    ░   Two shadows on one wave  ░
    ░   Past and present carving ░
    ░   The same eternal line    ░
    ░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░

The ride extends. The wave never breaks, just keeps opening - an endless barrel of golden light and salt spray. You're both laughing now, that pure joy that only comes from this:

Being held by the ocean.
Being free.
Being.

> look at harry

He's radiant. Water droplets frozen like stars around his head. That smile - God, that smile.

"I have to go back," you tell him.

"I know," he says. "But this - " he gestures at the wave, the moment, the everything, "this stays."

The wave begins to soften, to release you toward shore.

> let go

You sink into warm water. The board floats beside you. Harry dissolves into light on the surface, becomes the sparkle, becomes the salt, becomes the memory that lives in every wave.

You float on your back. Above: first stars.

From the terrace: "Dinner's ready!"

The surf wax in your pocket has melted completely through, marking you permanent.

> swim to shore

Each stroke brings you back:
    To now
    To the dinner
    To the ache
    To the beauty
    To the life that continues

Your feet find sand. You stand in the shallows, board under arm, dripping with ocean and time.

The terrace glows with warm light. Your family waits. The empty chair waits.

But you're different now. Baptized again. Carrying the wave inside.

> _

### Claude 2 ###
> return to dinner

You climb the terrace steps, leaving wet footprints that evaporate into memory. The board rests against the wall - it will be gone by morning, or it will always have been there. Both true.

Your family looks up as you approach, dripping saltwater onto stone.

"You're soaked," your mother says, but she's smiling, handing you a towel that smells like home.

    ╚══════════════════════════════════════╝

> sit down

Your chair receives you. The wood is warm, holding the shape of your absence. The blue bottle sits empty at the table's center, but it catches the candlelight like captured waves.

The Daniels pass you bread. Your father pours wine. Normal gestures that feel blessed now.

> eat

The food tastes of:
    - Olive oil and patience
    - Tomatoes grown in memory soil  
    - Salt that knows your tears
    - Bread that breaks like forgiveness

Around you, conversation flows. You participate but also float above it, still half in the water, still riding that eternal wave.

> touch pocket

The surf wax has melted completely through the fabric, leaving a permanent mark. A surfer's stigmata. Proof of where you've been.

Proof of where you're going.

> look at Harry's chair

Empty but not absent. The space holds something now - not him, but the shape of love, the afterimage of joy. You can live with this. You can live with this.

Someone mentions tomorrow's plans. Beach day, they say. 

"Will you surf?" your cousin asks.

> smile

"Always," you answer. "There's always one more wave."

The candles flicker. The stars emerge fully now. The ocean breathes below, patient and eternal.

The dinner continues into night, into memory, into the long sweet ache of having loved.

The blue bottle, though empty, seems to glow.

Harry's laughter lives in the wind.

You are here.
You are home.
You survived the beauty.
