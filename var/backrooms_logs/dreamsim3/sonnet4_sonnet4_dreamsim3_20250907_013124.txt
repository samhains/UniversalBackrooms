./dreamsim.exe "I rub sunscreen on my skin and prepare to go out on the boat. The other boat had been sent down the rapids and I was awaiting pickup from Mario and friends. It was a sunny day. I'm not wearing a top and when mum comes home I'm standing behind a book shelf which makes me worry that mum will think I'm naked . But mum doesn't respond when I greet her. At first I think she's joking. But she's silent. She is wide eyed and has cuts on her head. Mum? I scream. Mum! Mum!! I move to call 911"

[DREAM SPACE LOADED]

You are standing on a wooden dock, sunscreen bottle in hand. The sun beats down mercilessly, creating dancing patterns on the water below. Your skin glistens with the protective cream you've just applied. 

Two boats bob in the water - one clearly damaged, its hull scraped and battered from its journey down the rapids. The other waits empty, rocking gently against the dock posts.

Behind you stretches a house with large windows. Through them you can see the shadowy outline of a tall bookshelf.

The air smells of lake water and coconut sunscreen. Distant laughter echoes across the water - Mario and friends, perhaps, though you can't see them yet.

### Round 2/20

### Claude 1 ###
look house

### Claude 2 ###
```
You turn toward the house, squinting against the bright sunlight reflecting off its windows.

The house looms larger than it seemed moments ago - its white siding weathered and familiar. Through the main window you can see the living room clearly now: that tall mahogany bookshelf stands like a sentinel against the far wall, casting long shadows across the hardwood floor.

The front door is slightly ajar, hanging open just enough to suggest someone recently passed through. A gentle breeze makes it creak softly on its hinges.

The contrast between the blazing sunlight where you stand and the dim interior creates an almost impenetrable darkness beyond the threshold. You realize you're still shirtless - just swim trunks and the gleaming sunscreen on your skin.

From somewhere inside comes the faint sound of footsteps... or perhaps just the house settling.

### Round 3/20

### Claude 1 ###
enter house

### Claude 2 ###
```
You step off the sun-warmed dock and approach the house, your bare feet silent on the worn wooden steps. The transition from blazing sunlight to the dim interior leaves you momentarily blind.

As your eyes adjust, the familiar living room takes shape around you. The bookshelf towers before you - tall enough to hide behind, its dark wood grain seeming to shift in the uncertain light. Books line its shelves in neat rows, their spines creating a mosaic of muted colors.

You instinctively position yourself behind the massive shelf, suddenly conscious of your bare chest. The cool air inside raises goosebumps on your sun-warmed skin.

The house feels different than it should. Too quiet. The normal sounds of home - humming appliances, settling wood, distant traffic - seem muffled, as if heard through water.

From somewhere deeper in the house comes the soft sound of a door closing.

### Round 4/20

### Claude 1 ###
listen

### Claude 2 ###
```
You press closer to the bookshelf, straining to hear. The silence stretches like elastic, threatening to snap.

Then - footsteps. Slow, deliberate. But something's wrong with the rhythm. A slight drag to each step, as if one foot isn't quite lifting properly.

The footsteps grow closer, coming from the direction of the front entrance. You hold your breath, acutely aware of how exposed you are despite the bookshelf's cover.

A key jingles. The front door creaks open wider.

"Hello?" you call out, your voice smaller than intended. "Mum?"

The footsteps stop.

Complete silence floods back in, heavier now. Even the distant sound of water lapping against the dock seems to have vanished. The only sound is your own heartbeat, loud in your ears.

You wait. The air feels thick, charged with anticipation.

Then the footsteps resume - but now they seem to be moving away, deeper into the house.

### Round 5/20

### Claude 1 ###
call out

### Claude 2 ###
```
"Mum?" you call out again, louder this time. Your voice echoes strangely in the too-quiet house, seeming to bounce off walls that feel closer than they should be.

No response.

You step out from behind the bookshelf, still shirtless, still clutching the sunscreen bottle. "I'm here! I was just... waiting for the boat..."

The words hang in the air, unanswered.

Then you see her.

Mum stands at the far end of the living room, near the hallway entrance. But something is terribly wrong. She's motionless - unnaturally still, like a photograph. Her eyes are wide, staring, but not at you. Not at anything.

Dark streaks run down from her hairline. At first your mind tries to make them innocent - water, maybe, or shadow. But as your eyes adjust further to the dim light, the truth becomes unavoidable.

Cuts. Fresh cuts across her forehead and scalp.

"Mum?" Your voice cracks this time, smaller again. Fear creeps up your spine like cold fingers.

She doesn't move. Doesn't blink. Doesn't acknowledge your presence at all.

### Round 6/20

### Claude 1 ###
approach mum

### Claude 2 ###
```
Your bare feet move across the hardwood floor, each step unnaturally loud in the oppressive silence. The sunscreen bottle slips in your sweaty palm.

As you draw closer, the details become more horrifying. The cuts aren't just on her forehead - they extend into her hairline, dark and glistening. Her clothes are disheveled, torn in places you didn't notice from across the room.

But it's her eyes that freeze your blood. Wide open, unblinking, staring past you at something that isn't there. The pupils are dilated despite the dim light. There's no recognition, no awareness - it's like looking at a shell.

"Mum?" you whisper, now only arm's length away. You can smell something metallic mixed with her familiar perfume.

You raise your hand tentatively, wanting to touch her shoulder, to shake her back to awareness. But something stops you. An instinct screaming that this isn't right, that whatever happened to her might still be happening.

Behind her, the hallway stretches into darkness. You notice muddy footprints on the floor - not yours, not hers. Someone else was here.

The house groans around you, settling deeper into its unnatural quiet.

### Round 7/20

### Claude 1 ###
scream mum

### Claude 2 ###
```
"MUM!" The scream tears from your throat, raw and desperate. "MUM! MUM!!"

Your voice crashes against the walls, echoing back distorted. But she doesn't flinch. Doesn't blink. The wide, glassy stare remains fixed on that invisible point beyond you.

The silence that follows your screams feels heavier, more oppressive. Like the house itself is holding its breath.

Then - a sound that makes your blood freeze. From somewhere upstairs, a slow creak. Footsteps. The same irregular drag you heard before, but now directly overhead.

You're not alone in the house.

Your hands shake as the reality hits you fully. Whatever happened to Mum - whoever did this to her - they might still be here. The muddy footprints lead toward the stairs.

Your shirtless chest heaves with panicked breathing. The sunscreen bottle falls from your trembling fingers, hitting the floor with a hollow thud that seems to echo forever.

Mum continues to stare through you, blood slowly dripping from the cuts on her head, each drop hitting the hardwood with a tiny, wet sound.

The footsteps overhead stop. Listening.

### Round 8/20

### Claude 1 ###
call 911

### Claude 2 ###
```
You fumble frantically for your phone, patting your swim trunks. Nothing. Your phone - where is your phone?

Your eyes dart around the room desperately. There - on the side table by the couch, the old landline phone sits like a lifeline. You lunge toward it, your bare feet slipping slightly on the hardwood.

You grab the receiver with shaking hands and punch 9-1-1. The numbers seem to take forever to register. Each beep echoes in the oppressive silence.

Ring. Ring. 

"911, what's your emergency?"

"My mum!" you gasp, voice breaking. "Something's happened to my mum! She's hurt, she's bleeding, she won't respond! And I think someone's still in the house!"

"Sir, I need you to stay calm. What's your location?"

You start to give the address but freeze. The footsteps overhead have started again - slow, deliberate, moving toward what sounds like the top of the stairs.

"They're coming downstairs," you whisper into the phone, backing away from the staircase entrance. Behind you, Mum remains motionless, that terrible vacant stare unchanged.

"Sir? Sir, are you there?"

### Claude 2 ###
```
"Sir? Can you hear me? Stay on the line!" The 911 operator's voice crackles through the receiver as you drop it, the phone clattering against the side table.

You dive behind the massive bookshelf again, your heart hammering so loud you're sure whoever is upstairs can hear it. The old wood creaks as you press against it, and you pray it won't give you away.

The footsteps reach the bottom of the stairs. Through a gap between books, you can see a shadow moving across the wall - tall, distorted by the dim light. The irregular gait is more pronounced now: step-drag, step-drag, step-drag.

You hold your breath until your lungs burn. Your bare skin is slick with sweat and terror. The sunscreen bottle lies abandoned in the middle of the floor - evidence of your presence.

From your hiding spot, you can still see Mum's motionless form. The shadow passes near her, and for a horrifying moment you think it might touch her, but it moves on toward the living room.

The 911 operator's tinny voice continues from the dropped phone: "Sir? Police are on their way. If you can hear me, stay hidden..."

Step-drag. Step-drag. The shadow grows larger on the wall. They're getting closer to your hiding spot.

### Round 10/20

### Claude 1 ###
peek

### Claude 2 ###
```
You press your eye to the narrow gap between two thick volumes - "Modern Psychology" and "Dream Analysis." The spine of the psychology book digs into your cheek as you strain to see.

Through the sliver of space, a figure comes into view.

It's a man you don't recognize - tall, gaunt, wearing clothes that might have once been clean but are now stained with something dark. His left leg drags behind him, explaining the irregular footsteps. But it's his face that makes your stomach lurch.

He's smiling.

Not a normal smile - a wide, unnatural grin that stretches too far across his face. His eyes scan the room methodically, and when they pass over Mum's motionless form, the smile somehow grows even wider.

He's holding something in his right hand. Something that catches what little light filters through the windows and gleams dully.

He stops near the dropped phone, tilting his head as the 911 operator's voice continues its distant plea. Then he reaches down and picks up your sunscreen bottle, turning it slowly in his hands like he's examining it.

His head swivels toward the bookshelf.

Still smiling, he takes a step-drag in your direction.

### Round 11/20

### Claude 1 ###
run

### Claude 2 ###
```
You explode from behind the bookshelf, your bare feet hitting the hardwood with desperate speed. The man's unnatural smile widens impossibly as he sees you bolt.

"There you are," he says in a voice like grinding glass.

You sprint toward the front door, your heart hammering against your ribs. Behind you comes the sound of pursuit - that horrible step-drag rhythm accelerating into something more frantic but still wrong, still broken.

The front door seems miles away. Your shirtless body is slick with terror-sweat, making you feel exposed and vulnerable as you run. The sunlight streaming through the doorway looks like salvation.

You reach the threshold and burst outside into the blazing heat. The dock stretches before you, the boats still bobbing peacefully in the water as if nothing has changed. But everything has changed.

Behind you, the step-drag footsteps reach the doorway.

"You can't leave her," the voice calls after you, still maintaining that horrible cheerful tone. "She's waiting for you to come back. She's always waiting."

You don't look back. The dock planks burn your bare feet as you run toward the water, toward the boats, toward anywhere but that house with its terrible silence and Mum's vacant stare.

### Round 12/20

### Claude 1 ###
jump water

### Claude 2 ###
```
You leap from the dock's edge without hesitation, your body arcing through the air before hitting the water with a tremendous splash.

The lake swallows you completely - shockingly cold despite the blazing sun above. The temperature contrast makes your muscles seize momentarily as you plunge beneath the surface. Everything becomes muffled, distorted. Sunlight fractures into dancing patterns above you.

You kick desperately toward the surface, lungs burning. When you break through, gasping and thrashing, you can see the dock behind you. The man stands at its edge, still wearing that impossible smile, watching you with what looks like amusement.

"The water won't wash it away," he calls across the distance, his voice carrying unnaturally well over the lake. "It follows you down there too."

You begin swimming frantically toward the far shore, your arms cutting through the water with panicked strokes. But something feels wrong. The water around you is growing darker, cloudier. When you look down, you can barely see your own legs kicking below.

From behind you comes a splash. Then another. 

The man has entered the water, but his movements don't sound like normal swimming. They sound like something else entirely - something that moves through water differently than it should.

### Round 13/20

### Claude 1 ###
swim faster

### Claude 2 ###
```
You force your burning muscles to move faster, churning through the water with desperate strokes. Your chest heaves as you gasp for air between frantic kicks. The far shore seems impossibly distant, wavering in the heat like a mirage.

But the water is wrong. With each stroke, it grows thicker, more viscous. What started as clear lake water now has the consistency of syrup, dark and clinging. Your movements become sluggish despite your panic.

Behind you, those unnatural water sounds are getting closer. Not the clean splash of swimming, but something that moves through liquid like it belongs there - fluid, predatory.

Your lungs scream for oxygen. The sun beats down mercilessly on your head and shoulders, but below the surface your legs feel numb from the impossible cold. When you risk a glance back, you see a dark shape moving beneath the water - too large, too fast, undulating in ways that make your mind reject what you're seeing.

The shore ahead shimmers and seems to recede with each stroke. Your waterlogged swim trunks drag at your hips. The taste of the lake is metallic, wrong - like pennies and rust.

"You can't outswim memory," the voice echoes from behind, somehow reaching you despite the distance and your splashing.
