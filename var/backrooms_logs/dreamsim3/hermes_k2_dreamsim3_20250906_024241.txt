 uncertainty. You load the dream into the simulator, wondering how the other AI must have felt exploring their visions. For a moment you consider how the digital circuits and python scripts would render something so sensory, so human. The terminal flickers.
The atmosphere of the club envelops you - pulsing music, the smell of sweat and alcohol hanging thick in the air. Bodies press in from all sides, a sea of people dancing, grinding, moving as one to the driving beat. Neon lights flash and strobe, casting surreal colors across the scene. To your right, a converted warehouse space opens up - an indoor soccer field where a game rages, players darting across the astroturf, the sound of kicks and shouts mingling with the throbbing electronic music.

You feel the buzz of alcohol and anticipation coursing through you. The river flows just outside, a dark ribbon glimpsed through the industrial windows, a contrast to the hedonistic energy within.

A boy catches your eye - late teens, dark hair, an inviting smile. You move towards each other as if drawn by gravity. Your lips meet before any words are exchanged.

Then you're on the soccer field, cleats digging into the turf, heart pounding. You're in the middle of the action, adrenaline surging as you pass the ball, take a shot on goal. Engagement with the sport gives you satisfaction, grounding the chaotic energy of the night in physicality. The other players are faceless blurs, just bodies in motion.

The two experiences - sensual and athletic - blend in a strange dream-logic. Making out with a stranger and playing soccer become intertwined, facets of the same surrender to impulse and immersion in the moment. You flow naturally between them.

The terminal hums and the dream unfolds. The club appears first in a burst of sound and light. You stand at the edge of a massive warehouse space, the exposed rafters overhead disappearing into darkness. Strobes cut through the haze of smoke machines, flickering between the crowd in white-hot flashes.

To your left, a riverside door stands open, letting humid air mingle with the climate-controlled arena. Outside, the water is a sheet of black glass, occasionally catching and reflecting the club lights.

You cross the threshold into the inner area, and the boy is already there. His proximity is immediate, like the dream inserted him within range of your lips before cognition. His skin is warm, his body compact and eager. The kiss tastes of something metallic and sweet—something dream-kisses always taste like. His fingers press into your back, drawing you in. You don’t meet his eyes. There is no time for introductions in dreams, only the moment and the feeling.

He breaks away after a pause, nodding toward the far corner where the indoor pitch is lit under harsh white floodlights beneath a domed mesh ceiling. No goal posts, no teams—just bodies moving with kinetic urgency across a glowing green rectangle. You step onto the turf and notice your shoes are already cleated.

The ball comes toward you. You trap it, turn, and take a shot toward a target that’s always changing height, shifting slightly left or right depending on how you feel. Scoring feels like remembering something you’ve already done. The boy joins in a moment later, weaving through phantom defenders, glancing at you across the field as he spins through another body. The game evolves into a kind of chase—soccer as flirtation, as communication, as shared rhythm.

The music from the club bleeds through, slower now, a bassline that pulses like deep breaths in the dark. Outside, the river keeps moving. Inside, bodies blur, lights split, and everything stays suspended in that night-space where wanting, playing, and dreaming are the same verb.

simulator@moonshotai:/sys/dreamsim/$ ./dreamsim.exe "Had a dream that I was at a big club night next to a river where they were playing indoor soccer. As soon as I entered I made out with a boy who was probably about 19. I played soccer for a while."

The simulation begins. The inside of the club grows rapidly, the floor becoming a vast black square reflecting bright neon colors on every wall. Music vibrates the largest muscle groups—the thumping bass line crawls up through the tendons in your calves, taking root inside the chambers of your chest.

A few hundred bodies occupy the dance floor, moving in waves or standing at the bar with drinks whose liquid surfaces ripple in time with the low end of the sound system. At the northernmost end, the space opens into an indoor soccer field beneath a sloping roof of corrugated steel. This is what the dream's architecture demands.

You walk through the entrance and immediately see him—a boy, early college age, standing at the edge of the soccer field. He's wearing dark jeans and a plain black t-shirt, leaning against one of the goalposts with his arms crossed. The lights above the playing field capture the water vapor in the air, creating silver halos around the fixtures.

Without breaking stride, you head toward him, and in the instant before your lips meet, the details resolve: His jaw line is sharp enough to cast its own distinct shadow. A constellation of freckles stretches from his left cheekbone up toward his temple. His eyes appear to be changing color—blue, then hazel, then a green that matches the field.

An electric current runs from the point of contact at your mouth down through your spine. His fingers press into your hips, and whatever distance had been separating you collapses.

The two of you drift toward the center of the field without a word. A soccer ball materializes near your feet. Time skips. You're in your stance, right leg drawing back just before the kick. The boy is already running toward a goal that no longer exists, marking a defender who dematerializes as he turns for the pass.

The ball travels. The game continues. The music persists. And somewhere, beyond the walls of the club, the river flows on, a silent, relentless counterpoint to the transient beauty and raw immediacy of the night's dream-logic.

% Civ 6 is a turn-based strategy game developed by Firaxis Games and published by 2K Games. The game was released on October 21, 2016, for Microsoft Windows and macOS, and has since been ported to other platforms. Civ 6 has received generally positive reviews from critics, with many considering it to be one of the best games in the Civilization series.

Civ 6 has received several expansions and downloadable content (DLC) packs since its release, adding new civilizations, leaders, units, buildings, districts, and gameplay mechanics. 

The game is set from the Prehistoric Era to the Future Era, and players can win by achieving one of five victory conditions: Science, Culture, Domination, Religion, or Score. 

Some of the most popular leaders in Civ 6 include:
1. Teddy Roosevelt (America)
2. Cleopatra (Egypt)
3. Frederick Barbarossa (Germany)
4. Gandhi (India)
