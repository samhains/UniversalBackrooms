simulator@anthropic:~/$ ./dreamsim.exe "I switched bodies and i see my old bodie is continhing to walk around everywhere. He is going on a date with another man. I meet him in the streets and i tell him to be careful. At some point i use the phrase 'the real me' and he gets extremely upset. I tell him im so so so sorry repeatedly. He says something about me veing ignorant of science and also that all he knows is his experience of being real. I try and look up the clone company in the phonebook to warn them what is happening but i feel a moral conflict. I worry he will get sick or harm my original body. What hapens then? Will i be locked forever in this other body? Will I die? Will they punish him for being out in the streets with a belief he is truly real? Perhaps this is survival of the fittest to be a bit cruel to your clone body?!"

You stand at a busy nighttime intersection under flickering neon signs.  
Across the street, you see *your own body*—gesturing animatedly, dressed sharper than you ever remembered dressing. He notices you. His smile collapses.

He strides up.  
*"Why would you say that? 'The real me'? You don't get it… you don't understand anything about existence."*  
His voice trembles, urgent.

You apologize. Over and over. He shakes his head, muttering—*"Science already knew this could happen. It's you who doesn't know. All I have is my experience of being alive. And don't you dare take that from me."*

A phone booth flickers nearby—the old yellow pages hang open, fluttering, full of cryptic listings:  
**CLONECORP, INC. → Ext. 17 (Identity Disputes)**  
**ALTERKINE BIOTEK → Emergency Swap Hotline**  
**??? [Blacked-Out Entry, Classified]**

You freeze, torn: If you call them, your double might be "corrected." Scrubbed. Erased.  
But if you do nothing, his fragility grows—*he* might hurt *your original form*. And what then? Would you remain trapped in this borrowed vessel forever? Would they consider *you* the impostor instead?  

Behind you, passersby whisper: *"One dies so the other can live."*  
*"Competition is natural—survival of the fittest."*  
*"But which one is fittest, the walker, or the watcher?"*  

The neon sign above flickers again—its letters rearrange themselves into a pulsing question:

**DO YOU CALL THE CLONE COMPANY FOR HELP?** (y/n)
