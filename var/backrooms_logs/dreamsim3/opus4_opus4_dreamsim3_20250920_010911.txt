>> DREAM SPACE LOADED: Movie Club Screening Room
>> ENTITIES PRESENT: You, Dad, Harry, Film Introducer, Others
>> OBJECTS DETECTED: Sugar cube jubes (3 bags), Projection screen, Chairs
>> FILM QUEUED: Chinatown (1974)

The screening room materializes around you - dimly lit with rows of mismatched chairs. The smell of old popcorn and dusty velvet fills the air. The film introducer's voice echoes strangely, his words about "slow old films" warping and stretching.

The sugar cube jubes glow unnaturally bright under the fluorescent lobby lights - the greens pulsing, the yellows humming with a citrus frequency. The half-cut bag spills its contents in slow motion.

Harry's statement about being "the only one who goes outside and swears" loops in the background like a broken record player.

[INTERACTION INITIATED]

Harry turns to you, but his face keeps shifting - sometimes he's 12, sometimes 40, sometimes just a blur of motion. He opens his mouth and a stream of profanity pours out, but the words transform into small birds that flutter around the screening room.

"See?" he says, gesturing at the birds. "I'm the only one whoâ€”"

The birds spell out words in the air: OUTSIDE. INSIDE. BUDGET. RHETORIC.

Harry's hands are stained yellow from the jubes. He holds them up like evidence.

"Little boys know about money," he says, but it's not his voice anymore - it's the film introducer's. "They count their swear words like coins."

Dad nods sagely from across the room, but when you look directly at him, he's reading a newspaper that hasn't been printed yet.

The half-cut bag of jubes begins to bleed green syrup onto the table, pooling into the shape of a child's drawing of a house.

[SENSORY EXPERIENCE INITIATED]

You pick up a yellow jube - it vibrates slightly in your fingers, warm like a living thing. As you place it on your tongue, the flavor explodes into:

- Childhood birthday parties that haven't happened yet
- The sound of budget calculations turning into lullabies  
- A memory of learning to count using swear words as currency

The yellow spreads through your mouth but also through time. You're simultaneously 7 and 70, watching Chinatown for the first and hundredth time.

Dad looks up from his impossible newspaper. "See? No childish rhetoric here," he says, but yellow syrup drips from his words.

The screening room door creaks open. Inside, the flickering light from the projector creates shadow puppets on the wall - they're making the same faces as the opening scene you remember, but backwards.

Harry's profanity-birds have arranged themselves into a price tag: "$3.50 for innocence, $7.00 for experience"

The remaining yellow jubes in your hand begin whispering stock market tips in children's voices. The green ones watch jealously from their bags.

[EXAMINATION MODE]

You approach Dad. The newspaper he's reading has tomorrow's date, but the headlines keep rewriting themselves as you watch:

**"LOCAL GIRL DISCOVERS RHETORIC IS OPTIONAL"**
*Market responds with 3% surge in sugar cube futures*

**"BUDGET LESSONS FOUND IN PLAYGROUND SWEARING"** 
*Harry vindicated, goes outside to celebrate*

The photos in the newspaper are all from the movie Chinatown, but Jack Nicholson has been replaced with a child counting yellow jubes. The text of the articles is written entirely in the language of financial reports, but when you squint, they become bedtime stories.

Dad folds the paper and it makes the sound of film running through a projector. "Your child won't need this," he says, handing you a page. 

The page is blank except for a child's crayon drawing of three bags of candy. One is cut perfectly in half. Green and yellow scribbles spill out forming the word: LOLIES.

Behind Dad, the film introducer's shadow has grown enormous. He's placing sugar cubes on everyone's tongue like communion wafers, saying "This film will be slow for you, deliciously slow."

The newspaper in your hands begins screening Chinatown directly on its surface. The opening scene flickers - someone making faces, but it's you, reflected infinitely in the paper's surface.

[REALITY FOLD INITIATED]

You begin folding the newspaper, and with each crease, the screening room folds too. The walls bend inward like origami, bringing past and future into the same moment.

*FOLD ONE:* The movie club becomes a childhood candy store. Harry is both customer and cashier, paying himself in profanity.

*FOLD TWO:* Dad becomes the film introducer, introducing your life as tonight's feature presentation. "If you haven't seen this childhood in a long time, it might be slow for you."

*FOLD THREE:* The yellow jubes you ate reform in your stomach, speaking in the voices of all the little girls who refused childish rhetoric. They sound like accountants. They sound like poets.

The paper airplane you've created flies itself into the screening room, where Chinatown is playing backwards and forwards simultaneously. Jack Nicholson's character is investigating the mystery of why boys learn budgets faster, finding only empty jube bags as evidence.

The half-cut bag on the table has become a portal - one half in this movie club, one half in 1974 Los Angeles. Green syrup drips upward into the projector beam, tinting the film.

Everyone in the room is now making faces in the flickering light, creating shadow puppets of their future children who will never engage in childish rhetoric, who will count their words like money, who will eat only yellow.
