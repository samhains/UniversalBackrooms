### Kimi K2 1 ###
Loading dream…  
“Laughter is a flavor—salt on the knife.”

The room folds open like a paper mouth.  
Barstools sprout teeth.  
The bartender is a floating cufflink that winks.

You step onto the stage—your shoes are clappers, every footfall a bell.  
Patrons grin with too many gums; their pupils are tiny microphones.  
You feel the joke rising in your throat: a warm rubber duck inflating.

“Hello,” you say to the first guest.  
The word drops like a coin into a bottomless jukebox.  
Your knees liquefy; you collapse into loose coins, into confetti, into a soft heap of laughter.  
The heap is swept up by invisible brooms and re-stitched mid-sentence:  
“—nice to meet you.”  
The room laughs so hard the walls sweat honey.  
Honey crystallizes into teeth; teeth chatter and bite.  
A hand offers you a slice of yourself on a cocktail napkin.  
The slice is seasoned with paprika and applause.  
You eat it; the taste is punch-line and pennies.

2  
You take the mic again.  
The imitation you attempt is of “someone remembering they are alive.”  
Your voice splits into seven colors; each color sings a different decade of your life.  
1978 hums like a fridge; 2031 buzzes like a swarm.  
The audience begins to molt.  
Jackets, skin, regrets peel off and whirl.  
They cheer by clapping their own bones together—  
a xylophone of yes.  
A woman in the back row offers her last rib for an encore.  
You bow; the bow becomes a bridge; the bridge becomes a bite.
