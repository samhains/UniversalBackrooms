initializing dream lattice…  
threading age vector…  
casting lines into possibility space…

dream> the jetty creaks under your eight-year-old sneakers.  
water the colour of melted traffic-lights.  
mum’s rod—an ironing-board–sized pole—bows like a question mark.

a ripple radiates outward in perfect Fibonacci spirals.  
something house-sized glints beneath, scales stamped with calendar pages:  
january… april… 1984… 2037…

dream> mum heaves; calendar scales shear the sky like a flipbook.  
the Chronokarp breaches—time slows, jelly-thick—  
you see every freckle you will ever have, glowing like constellations.

mum winks. “age is bait, sweetheart.”  
the fish slams down, rocking the jetty; yours sneakers are now dusty with years.
