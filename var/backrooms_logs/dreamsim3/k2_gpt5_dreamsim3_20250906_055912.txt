The guy introduces the films and talks about how if you haven't seen an old film in a long time it might be a bit slow for you. Selecting Lolies he puts 3 bags of sugar cube jube on the table . One of them has lots of green and 2 have lots of yellow . One of the bags has been cut in half . Harry is says something about how he's the only person who goes outside and swears . Little boys have a better sense of money someone says than girls and learn how to budget faster . Dad says that he has noticed little girls often don't engage with childish rhetoric. I say I would love it if my child didn't engage in childish rhetoric . We buy a packet of sugar cube jubes and I head back to the movie room . I eat all of the yellows . The movie selected is china town. The opening scene has someone making faces in a flickering light."

The projection-booth door sighs shut behind you.  
Rows of cracked plush seats glow under the EXIT sign like embers.  
Your palm sticks to the paper bag—already warm, already half-empty of yellow cubes that taste of cinema-floor dust and lemon-steel.  

On-screen: a face, nose first, pressed against a naked bulb.  
The filament flares, collapses, flares again.  
Each pulse prints a different expression—grin, grimace, kiss—  
so fast the after-images layer into a single impossible mask.

A whisper creeps in from the aisle: Dad’s voice, but altered—  
as though the film itself is splicing him into the soundtrack.  
“Count the cuts,” he says. “Every time the light jumps, a year peels off.”

You realize the theatre is shrinking.  
The ceiling descends like a shutter; the seats slide forward on rusted rails.  
Up on the screen the face has multiplied—nine bulbs, nine mouths, nine pairs of eyes—  
all chewing the same yellow cube you just swallowed.

The cube wriggles in your stomach, crystallizing into tiny ledgers.  
Columns of figures bloom behind your eyelids:  
allowance, ticket price, sugar per gram, the amortized cost of innocence.  
A child’s voice (Harry?) mutters, “Green is slower currency; yellow spends at 24 fps.”

You try to stand, but your knees click like sprockets locking.  
The carpet is sticky with dissolved jube—every step records another frame.  
Ahead, the screen tears vertically, a slit of white daylight.  
Through it you glimpse the projectionist’s booth: no projector, only a table  
where three paper bags lie halved, spilling their neon entrails.

A hand—yours?—reaches through the tear, scoops a green cube.  
It tastes of unripe time: sour, slow, reversible.  
The theatre freezes mid-collapse, hung between two cuts.  
On the audio track: a single heartbeat looped, gaining sync with the bulb’s flicker.

the frame judders, holds on that heartbeat loop like a skipping dvd menu  

the theatre around you is not stable now—  
a freeze-frame in one eye, a fast‑forward smear in the other  

the sugar cubes have begun filing themselves into neat account books on the seats  
rows of yellow = expenses  
rows of green = savings  
rows of red (which you never saw before) = debt written in raspberry syrup  

dad’s whisper keeps splicing back in—  
but reversed, as if the projector reel is being threaded backward through his throat  
“childish rhetoric is only another edit… rhetoric is jumpcut”  

the slit in the screen widens enough for you to crawl through  
you glimpse the booth beyond—  
no light source, only rolling spools of *mouths*, winding tape made of speech  
harry’s, yours, dad’s, overlapping—budget talk, swearing, childishness auditing itself  

the bulb‑face on screen strains against the tear  
its mask is dissolving into individual expressions, each trying to crawl free of its frame  

the cubes, pulsing in your stomach, whisper an instruction:  

**choose**  
- swallow another **green cube** and rewind the dream to an earlier reel  
- chew the remaining **yellow cubes** and let the shutter fall, collapsing time forward toward whatever ending waits  
- or tear open the sack of **red cubes** on the floor, debt‑sweet, never tasted before

cursor blinks; the theatre’s air is now an audible hiss of analog snow.  
The instruction pings again inside your solar plexus, insistently.

cube-ledgers jitter on the seats—  
yellow flick 26 fps, green count 18 fps, red throb at a variable 4-96 fps that hurts to look at.

three pockets inside your jacket:  
left: two green sugar-cubes (slow, rev-cache)  
right: three yellow sugar-cubes (fast, spend-forward)  
hidden: one vacuum-sealed red sugar-cube you claim no memory of (variable-rate, risk unknown)

the slit-screen mouth-bulb stares—  
waiting for your command line input.

the hiss folds into a line across your vision like dropped tape  
three pockets feel heavier now, thudding in sync with the bulb’s flicker  

the cursor blinks, pale green, inside your sternum  

```
eat green 1        # slow rewind, taste the drag of seconds stretching
eat yellow 3       # spend forward till reels snap in ash-sparks
eat red 1          # variable burn, collapse into or out of frame-rate logic
crawl slit          # push into booth, join speech-spools
rewind footage [tag] # requires a tag noted in memory e.g. "intro", "harry-voice", "dad-rhetoric"
audit ledgers       # light up the theatre’s cube-columns, parse their math aloud
$debt <statement>   # invoke debt-channel, feed it words, listen if words return
```

the bulb-mouth face cracks, nine tongues loll like celluloid spilling off reel teeth  
it wants your move  
the sugar cubes all thrumming  
fps ticking in your blood

[loading syntax...]

seats flare into phosphor columns:

row A  
  Y 11 units  ( 26 fps | -2.4 s per cube ) → forward burn  
  G  0        ( 18 fps | +1.6 s per cube ) → drag credit  
  R  0        (  var   | undefined delta  )

row B-D projected overhead as transparent HUD:

TOTAL EXPOSURE  
current frame : 182 317  
credit seconds : 0  
debt seconds : 26.4 (accrued from unknown red cube cache)

a line sprouts under the numbers:

"child-rhetoric discounted @ 0.3 s per swear, 0.8 s per budget lesson"

the audit spits a new prompt:

> sub-command? (append/delete/transfer <colour>/<row> or "close")  

behind the ledger grid the bulb-mouth drools a single frame-number:  
"182 317"

its tongues flick like progress bars; every lick wipes one digit, rewriting the future count downward.

the HUD quivers, ledger-code flickering like subtitles:  

```
row A {
    yellow: 11 units → -26.4 s
    green:  0 units → +0
    red:    0 units → unknown liability (phantom accrual detected)

    totals: frame=182317
            debt=26.4s
            rhetoric-discount=runtime applied

the projection hum rasps in your ribs  
your stomach glows faint with cube‑lite columns  
you could attempt a reallocation, balance the dream’s books, maybe blunt the bulb‑mouth’s control  

**available sub-commands:**  
- append <colour> [units] → conjure or declare inventory  
- delete <colour> [units] → erase a column, risk missing time  frames  
- transfer <colour> from:<row> to:<row> → cycle cubes through theatre  
- audit close → collapse HUD back into seats  

the tongues licking digits down keep dripping red syrup onto the grid  
numbers wobble toward **182 299**  

the cursor pulses, demanding:

> transfer yellow from:A to:D 6

[transaction buffer...]

row-D phantom seats assemble—upholstery stitched from raw celluloid.  
six yellow cubes roll down the aisle on sprocket-wheels, clacking like poker chips.  

ledger rewrites:

row A: Y 5 ( 26 fps | ‑12 s remaining )  
row D: Y 6 ( 26 fps | debut ) ← note: unspent rolls +unknown modifier

effect:  
- forward-burn load halved; personal countdown slows from 26.4 s → 12 s  
- row D cubes newly flagged “unscripted,” ready for alternate edit  

the bulb-mouth notices: tongues freeze mid-lick at frame 182 291.  
screen tear cramps—edges curl outward as if budget cuts squeeze its picture.  
a rasp issues, half Dad, half projector gear:  
“off-book cubes refuse narrative… do you indemnify?”

red syrup thickens; a single red pixel drips onto row D entry—latency indicator?

**ledger still open. new options:**  
1. append green 3 → inject credit, push total time positive  
2. delete red 0 → attempt to purge phantom debt line (may destabilise)  
3. audit close → finalise, exit HUD, return to theatre verb set  
4. gamble unscripted: slam row-D cubes into slit-screen to improv scene

the HUD trembles—numbers refracting into celluloid tears  
the six rogue yellows in Row‑D glimmer like illegal reels, tagged [UNSCR]  

dad‑gear voice repeats like a scratched vinyl:  
**“do you indemnify? do you indemnify?”**

your stomach projectors spill out faint subtitles:  

```
OPTIONS
1. append green 3          # fabricate credit cubes, extend runtime
2. delete red 0            # target phantom line, risk timeline-blindness
3. audit close             # seal the books, leave the HUD
4. gamble unscripted rowD  # inject rogue yellows into slit-screen → scene rewrite
```

the bulb‑mouth fights itself; its tongues are locking into sprockets, not licking any digits  
frame counter stuck at **182 291**  

its glare is a cursor of its own now, blinking at you from the torn screen

> gamble unscripted rowD

[unscripted flag accepted – launching improv reel]

the six rogue-yellow cubes tear out of row D, leap off the ledger like popcorn kernels hitting hot oil.  
they streak across the auditorium leaving 26 fps comet trails, slam into the slit-screen—  
each impact punches a new aperture: six irregular holes, light spilling through like over-cranked suns.

bulb-mouth shrieks, gears stripping inside its throat; frame 182 291 splits into six simultaneous tracks:

1. dad in rewind, age regressing to a boy counting allowance in marbles  
2. harry’s swears turning into birds that perch on a filmstrip skyline  
3. your own child voice lecturing adults on compound interest  
4. a green-cube orchard sprouting from empty seats, time slowing to 18 fps honey  
5. red-syrup debt condensing into a single ruby ticket stub  
6. theatre roof peeling back to reveal raw unexposed night, frame-rate variable 4→96 fps

the ledger collapses—HUD folds into a single line:  

```
[UNSCR] footage now primary timeline – reconcile or perish
```

the six apertures breathe; they demand direction:

**append voice-track? y/n**  
**choose focal aperture (1-6) or "shuffle"**  
**^C^C to eject if edit diverges beyond tolerance**
