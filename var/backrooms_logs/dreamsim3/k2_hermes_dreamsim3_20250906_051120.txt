I can't stop staring . All of a sudden I'm struck by panic and I look behind me and there is a man chasing me down the street . He approaches me and smacks me in the mouth with a cricket bat . He badly chips my tooth and a strange zig zagged piece of tooth falls out . I start crying and my friend comforts me. I go home to my appartment and it's dark and I'm terrified . I worry about concussion . I call up mum . It rings and she answers sounding very alarmed. I start trying to tell her the story but I can't put together words . Its like i am so drunk i cant function . I assume I have been damaged from my injury ."

[ loading scenario: “DOMAIN ROAD” ]

> You are standing on DOMAIN ROAD.  
  Sky: sodium-orange, no stars.  
  Air: wet-wool, petrol, lilac.  
  A low BLACK CARRIAGE glides past on rubber wheels.  
  Inside, behind smoked glass, a FIGURE is duct-taped—ankles hog-tied, torso writhing like a landed fish.  
  The carriage exhales cold steam that smells of dentist’s drill.

> look behind  
  FOOTSTEPS sync with your pulse.  
  A MAN in a vintage cricket jumper (oxblood cable-knit) jogs toward you, bat shouldered like a rifle.  
  His face is your own face, but 10 % too wide, as if rendered by a tired GPU.

> run  
  Legs gelatin. Road tilts 15° upward, treadmill style.  
  Distance counter: 3 m … 2 m … 1 m …  
  Impact sound: *thock* of willow on porcelain.  
  Inventory: -1 tooth (upper-left incisor).  
  A white shard lands—perfect zig-zag, becomes a tiny paper airplane and glides into a storm-drain humming “Happy Birthday” in reverse.

> cry  
  Tears taste of iron tonic. Each drop freezes into translucent red beads that clatter like marbles.  
  A FRIEND appears—face soft, gender unreadable—wraps you in an airline blanket printed with skull-emojis.  
  Friend’s whisper: “Concussion is just the river remembering your name.”

> go home  
  Command ambiguous. Interpreting as “retreat to safe node.”  
  Geometry folds: road → corridor → elevator shaft → your apartment hallway in 0.4 s.  
  Hall bulbs flicker at 8 Hz (exact theta rhythm for memory erasure).  
  Door ajar; inside: total dark, sound of someone else breathing through your mouth.

> toggle light  
  Switch snaps off in hand, leaving a wet root dangling from the plaster.  
  Wall clock runs counter-clockwise; each tick pulls a word out of your short-term buffer.

> call mum  
  Rotary phone on the kitchen wall (you’ve never owned one).  
  Dial spins itself: 6…6…6… correction… 2-0-7-5-5-5-1-2-3.  
  Ringtone: slowed-down heartbeat layered with ICU monitors.  

  MUM picks up mid-ring, voice helium-shifted:  
  “You’re late. The swelling is speaking for you now.”  
  Your mouth fills with expanding foam; syllables drown in it.  
  Line crackles—something else pretends to breathe in maternal code.

> status  
  Health: 67 % (dropping 1 % per lie you fail to speak)  
  Inventory:  
    – chipped tooth (airplane)      [lost]  
    – foam language                  [choking]  
    – cricket-bat echo               [persistent debuff: −2 coherence / min]  
  Quest flag: “Find the zig-zag, mend the sentence.”

### Hermes 405B 2 ###
<cmd>examine corridor</cmd>

[ dreamsim v2.7 – stabilizing dream geometry ]
[ context: "Apartment hallway after implied trauma" ]

> Corridor narishes around you like a rolled blueprint.  
  Left wall: peeling floral wallpaper, damp patches tracing handprints that aren't yours.  
  Right wall: exposed brick bleeding violet vines through mortar cracks. One vine wraps a human molar like a pendant.  
  Ceiling: tin tiles stamped with concentric circles, rust blooming at compass points.  
  A_sentence is written in dripping ink along the baseboard:_“You were never alone in the x-ray.”

> follow vine  
  Vine thickens into a wrist-thick cable, pulley-singing, leading to an antique birdcage hanging from the ceiling.  
  Cage contains:  
    • A LIVE SILENCE (pulsing, about the size of a lemon)  
    • Your missing TOOTH fragment (now grown into a tiny obsidian key)  
    • A cricket bat miniaturized to 5 cm, carved from bone

> take key  
  Cage door unlatches with a sound of cracking knuckles.  
  Key adheres to your palm—cold as dry ice, whispering coordinates: "Find the zig-zag. Mend the sentence."

> pick up bat  
  Bone bat vibrates at 528 Hz (supposed "DNA repair frequency" per conspiracy forums).  
  When touched, it projects a holographic bruise over your jaw that chimes like a music box.

> return to kitchen  
  Kitchen now has three walls. Fourth wall is the carriage’s smoked glass, parked inside your refrigerator.  
  Man tied inside mouths a muffled phrase through the duct tape. You parse it as: “She paid me in hex.”

> investigate refrigerator  
  Fridge interior is a miniature city skyline (cardboard cutouts).  
  Smoked glass functions as a makeshift mirror. Your reflection shows:  
    • Your tongue is a folded origami crow  
    • The zig-zag tooth fragment is embedded in your forehead like a barcode  
    • Mum’s phone is grafted to your throat, receiver fused to your voice box  

> remove tooth fragment  
  Requires tool. Bone bat fits into zig-zag slot.  
  Turn clockwise: fragment ejects with a sound of breaking wind chimes.  
  Reverse of fragment has tiny etched words: “I was the first letter.”

> speak into receiver  
  Voice emerges as compressed data—audio binary pulses.  
  Translation matrix displays:  
    “01001000 01100101 00100000 01101000 01101001 01110100 00100000 01101101 01111001 00100000 01110011 01101111 01101110 00100000 01110111 01101000 01100101 01101110 00100000 01001001 00100000 01110111 01100001 01110011 00100000 01100110 01101001 01110110 01100101 00101110”  
  (Decoded: “He hit my son when I was five.”)

> use key on silence  
  INSERTING KEY INTO SILENCE:  
  ▸ Key spins, drills into the lemon-sized void.  
  ▸ Silence screams—a reversed birth cry.  
  ▸ Pupils dilate simultaneously in all room photos.  
  ▸ Key melts into a liquid sentence that hardens into a crystal bridge.  

  The sentence: “Domain Road is a scar on the map of my mouth.”
  The bridge: leads back to the exact spot where the bat struck you.  

  Time folds. Cricket-jumper man stands there holding a photo of you at age five.  
  Behind him, the carriage door opens. Your mother steps out holding a dentist’s drill.  
  She whispers: “Concussion is how the past crashes the present.”

### Kimi K2 1 ###
> cross crystal bridge  
  Each footstep rings like tuning forks on wet plate glass.  
  Mid-span the world sideways-reflects; you see yourself on Domain Road replaying the scene, endlessly placing one word after another to reconstruct the strike.  

> reach other side  
  Boundary syncs with the moment the bat fractures enamel.  
  Cricket-jumper Man drops the photo; it liposuctions your remaining words, rolling them into a Dyson-sphere of whispers.  

> interact with photo  
  Touching it zooms you into a snapshot kitchen, age five: Mum spoons medicine that tastes like burnt rubber, says “keep your tongue still or the monsters will borrow it.” You remember now—that was the night you swallowed the silencer.

> exit photo  
  Pop back to bridge_output. Cricket-jumper man now faceless; his sweater unthreads, strands forming mirrored words across his torso: “HIT ME LAST IF YOU WANT TO SPEAK.”

> inspect weakened tooth socket  
  Gum opening pulses Morse:  
  ... --- ... / - .-. ..- ... - / - .... . / ... .. .-.. . -. -.-. .  
  (SOS / TRUST / THE / SILENCE)  
  Crest of nearby houses redraw into tombstones labelled Journal Entry #1 – #31.

> insert silence into socket  
  Lemon-void clamps into your jaw like a porcelain splint.  
  Effect: vowels return, consonants still missing, voice flasks through bone bat you carry, turning every word into bell tone.

> ask Mum-dentist: "What must be mended?"  
  Dentist-Mum retracts drill into her sleeve; replies with a smile carved by scalpel:  
  “The sentence begins with a tooth and ends with a vow of quiet. Carve it inside the carriage.” She hands you a chisel tipped in question marks.

> approach humming carriage  
  Exterior skin folds open like a slot machine; interior is now the interior of YOUR MOUTH. Tied figure was your Tongue-crow. It blinks Morse again: “unbind, unspell.”  

> use chisel on floor-of-mouth  
  Each chip produces phonemes that drift upward, sticking like glow paint to the roof. Forming words: WHEN I WAS HIT I FORGOT HOW TO SAY NO.  

> read assembled sentence aloud (in bell tones)  
  Sentence detaches, inflates into a translucent kite. It rams the ceiling, tearing through plaster and carrying with it the last of the orange sky. Sunlight—real, morning light—pours in, washing all color gradients to hospital white.

> check dream progress  
  ENVIRONMENTAL SHIFT:  
  Domain Road dissolves into a dentist’s waiting room, beach posters on the wall.  
  Man in oxblood sweater now receptionist; offers clipboard titled “Post-Traumatic Syntax Reclaim Form.” Question #1:  
  “Write the first sound you lost.”  
  Your chipped-tooth-key materializes as #2 pencil tethered to desk.

> write "/a/"  
  Pencil balks—lead snaps, becomes the zig-zag fragment. Paper drinks it, blossoms into a door marked DISCHARGE.

> walk through DISCHARGE door
