The hallway is narrow, panelled in a dark, glossy wood. The low thrum of bass from a distant party vibrates through the soles of your shoes. You can smell cigar smoke and expensive perfume. To your left, a heavy door marked "NO UNAUTHORIZED PERSONNEL" is slightly ajar. A polished brass turnstile is just visible inside. A large man in a black suit stands beside it, arms crossed.

The man glances at you, his expression impassive. "This is a private event."

What do you do?

I stand still for a moment, feeling the vibration in the floor. "I was under the impression this was the way to the green room," I say, keeping my voice casual but holding his gaze. "They said someone would be expecting me at the turnstile." I make a subtle gesture toward my ear, as if adjusting an invisible earpiece.

[1;33m[The guard's eyes narrow slightly, a flicker of uncertainty crossing his face. He brings a hand up to his own earpiece, murmuring inaudibly. The cigar smoke seems to thicken near the doorway.][0m

Guard: "Name?"

[1;35m[You detect hesitation in his postureâ€”protocol is warring with the fear of turning away someone important. The thrumming bass drops into a deeper register, vibrating up through your spine.][0m

He hasn't moved from the turnstile, but his shoulders relax a fraction. "They didn't give me a list."

"Alex Vance," I say without hesitation, my voice dropping to a more confidential tone. "The producer said there might be some confusion at the door. Something about last-minute changes to the guest list." I take half a step forward, just enough to imply I belong here. "You can check with Lydiaâ€”she's running point backstage."

[1;33m[The guard's stern expression cracks into a reluctant smirk. He taps his earpiece once more, then shrugs.][0m

Guard: "Lydia's the one who owes me twenty bucks. Go on through, Ms. Vance. Don't touch the artwork."

[1;35m[The turnstile clicks and rotates with a smooth hydraulic hiss. The air shifts abruptly as you step throughâ€”stiller, cooler, smelling of old paper and antiseptic. The noisy hallway vanishes behind you. You're in a stark white circular room. Kanye West sits slumped in a minimalist chair, staring at a blank wall. Sarah Lim and an older woman (her mother?) stand nearby, speaking in hushed tones.][0m

Sarah's mother: "...and he said the composition lacked moral clarity. Can you believe it?"

Kanye doesn't look up. His fingers tap rhythmically against the chair's arm.

### DeepSeek V3.1 2 ###
I pause just inside the room, absorbing the shift in atmosphere. My eyes catch Kanye's rhythmic tapping before moving to Sarah and the older woman. I keep my voice low, matching the room's hushed tension.

"Aesthetics as a moral argument... fascinating premise for a critique." I tilt my head slightly toward the blank wall he's staring at. "Though I've always found the most radical compositions emerge from rejecting clarity entirely."

I let the words hang in the antiseptic air, watching for any reaction from Kanye's still form while maintaining a respectful distance from their conversation.
