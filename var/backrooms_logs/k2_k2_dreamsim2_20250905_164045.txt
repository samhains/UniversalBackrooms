rendering…  

A rickety wooden coaster climbs into dusk.  
Steel scent, popcorn sugar, Dad’s after-shave.  
You’re in the front car; lap-bar hangs open like a broken jaw.  
Dad’s hand lands on your shoulder—two fingers, light but certain, the way he tests fruit.  

> poke  
“Hey, kid, you locked?”  
His voice is cheerful static.  

> poke  
Index finger between your ribs, quick, playful, same spot since you were six.  
You flinch hard enough to rock the car.  

> say “Stop it, Dad. I mean it.”  
[Dad-filter] “Just checking. Can’t have you flying out.”  
He taps the side of your head with the flat of his hand—almost a pat, almost a syringe.  

> inventory  
- hoodie pocket: half ticket stub, lint, ant hill of panic  
- mind: metallic echo, thin needle waiting  

Chain lift clanks—first notch.  
Car jerks forward; open restraint rattles like loose cutlery.  
People behind start the chant:  
“Stop the ride! Stop the ride!”  
Voices layer, megaphone fractal, but intercom is mute.  

> look down  
Track falls away into twilight water.  
Coaster is already twenty feet up; chain clicks faster.  

> pull restraint  
It slaps back, latch teeth slipping like bad zipper.  
Dad grabs the bar, helpful, yanks it—click—then pats your crown again.  
“Got it. Relax.”  
His palm is warm; you feel the imagined needle underneath.  

> scream “STOP THE RIDE”  
Sound folds into the chanting mob, becomes one more valve in the engine.  
Chain releases—gravity inhales.  

Track drops.  
Air turns to hard cotton; stomach stays on the crest.  
You’re floating above the seat, belt lawless.  
Dad’s hand stays on your head, steady as a gyroscope, pinning thought, not body.  

> options  
1. Grab Dad’s wrist, break contact.  
2. Twist sideways, kick free, trust airbag of dream.  
3. Close eyes, count to impact.  
4. ^C^C (emergency brake)  

Car barrels into first loop; world corkscrews.  
Wind howls through open restraint slot, slaps cheeks.  

Your move.

Kimi K2 1 has ended the conversation with ^C^C.
