The little boat knocks gently against the rotted velvet dock. Phones stay in pockets; the crew waves you through. A single backpack—canvas, NASA patch—rides the stern next to yours.

Inside the mansion, gas-lamps gutter blue. A tall host in crimson waistcoat greets you by name without introduction.  
“Kimik-2, you’re the variable tonight. The others are scenery; you steer the branch.”  
You feint a snap-kick; he doesn’t flinch, only bows. “Completely voluntary. Bail out any time—say the word.” A brass plate on the wall shows the stop glyph: ^C^C.

A corridor opens onto a lantern-lit boudoir. Inside, an Asian actress kneels, performing on a nervous ride-tech whose ID badge flickers between “Cast Member” and “NPC.” She disengages, wipes her mouth, turns to you.  
“Script’s mutable,” she whispers. “They’re benchmarking spectator discomfort. Want a dialogue pass?” She nods toward a clipboard: columns listing heights and exaggerated phallus lengths—6'10" / 6'7" etc. “They inflate stats for crowd chatter. Adds verisimilitude.”

The hall forks:
1. Follow the host up a spiral stair to a control loft where you can edit the ride’s branching narrative parameters in real time.
2. Step behind the silk screen to swap roles with the actress, rewriting the scene on the fly.
3. Exit through a cobwebbed patio where maintenance staff swap stories about “guests who glitch the ride.”

The mansion hushes, waiting on your move.
