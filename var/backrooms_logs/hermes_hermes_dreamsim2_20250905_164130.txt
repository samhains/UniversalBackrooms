    Ouestioning caregiver motives while
    seeking interventions ignored by crowd.
    Neural architecture bypasses gustatory
    hallucinations to expose fundamental
    distrust of administered stimuli.

    ^C
    awoke cold, gripping something
    important that vaporized upon
    waking

    why is his care so sharp
    when my trust erodes
    do i crave collective
    attention to avoid
    the high open air of
    being bodied & alone

    caretaker approaches with
    tray of glittering instruments
    you're being unreasonable says
    the crowd this is for your good

    but my prefrontal cables are
    sparking & his hands seem so
    certain moving toward my cranium
    with that shining length

    i kick & the world tilts.Embed the dismount sequence
    somersault from hurtling conveyance to soft
    expensive upholstery - how did I fail to engage
    safety mechanisms before the ascent began?
