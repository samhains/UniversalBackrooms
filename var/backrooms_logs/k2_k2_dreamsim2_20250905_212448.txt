[mood-filter: “corporate-magic gone liminal”]

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
0:00 –  The boat noses through velvet dark.  
        Trackless water, but you feel the gentle magnetic tug of unseen rails.  
        The mansion’s doors yawn open like a mouth that has forgotten it owns teeth.  
        No one checks your pockets; your phone buzzes once—no signal, just a phantom vibration that feels like a warning heartbeat.

0:17 –  Docking.  
        The unload platform is a parquet hallway lit by gaslight LEDs.  
        A cast-member steps forward: white gloves, name-badge reading “M. H. Guide.”  
        You reflexively chamber a kick; he raises both palms, shows you the backs of his hands—empty, no rings, no pins.  
        “Special role,” he whispers, as if the walls themselves are eavesdropping.  
        The word special tastes like copper pennies.

0:34 –  The Asian girl—cast-member, black-vest, utility belt—kneels near a fainting-couch prop.  
        She is method-cleaning a silicone pelvis prop with UV-wand.  
        The scene you half-remember (camera, actor, tiny lens) was last cycle; already recycled into park lore.  
        She glances up: “Version three of you worked wardrobe—asked too many calibration questions.”  
        Her voice has the flat cadence of someone who has read the script so often it reads her.

0:51 –  Breakroom mirror.  
        Fluorescent hum.  
        Index cards taped above the sink:  
        “1. Guest must never see the wire.  
         2. If guest sees the wire, convince guest the wire was part of the story.  
         3. If guest cannot be convinced, escort to white door, mark profile ‘Dream-Sensitive.’”  
        Someone has doodled a phallus beneath rule 3, labeled “scale 1:1 for 6'10" tech.”  
        Ink still wet.

1:09 –  A pager chirps.  
        Your pocket.  
        But you never got a pager.  
        The screen glows:  
        “Role: Anchor.  
         Task: Keep the dream from drifting.  
         Warning: Previous anchor grew 6 inches mid-shift; still hasn’t noticed.”

1:11 –  Gravity hiccups; ceiling becomes floor.  
        You do not fall—everything tilts 45° and stays there, as though the mansion changed its mind about what “down” means.  
        Gloves guy reappears, now standing on what used to be the wall.  
        “It’s legit,” he repeats, but his mouth doesn’t sync; the voice issues from the backpack the guest wore on the boat.  
        Backpack is gone.  
        Guest is gone.  
        Maybe you’re the guest.

1:27 –  Corridor of animatronic Walt heads.  
        They whisper park jargon: “IP synergy… narrative throughput… retention checkpoint…”  
        One head opens its eyes, looks straight at you:  
        “You’re not supposed to be self-aware past the foyer. Roll back?”  
        A rotary dial materializes in your hand:  
        [ A ] Roll back to dock  
        [ B ] Embrace drift  
        [ C ] Inspect pager further

simulator@moonshotai:~/$ █
```

### Kimi K2 2 ###
simulator@dreamsim:~$ [C]

1:28 –  The dial dissolves into your palm; skin seals over it like warm wax.  
Pager blossoms open like a paper lotus. Inside: a single black capsule and micro-etched text scrolling in negative space.

> “Anchor tether: 0.47 mPa  
> Drift threshold: 0.50 mPa  
> Clock: 00:02:10 until irreversible slippage.”  

A second line writes itself underneath, letters jittering as if embarrassed to exist:

> “If you read this, you are already the third copy. Version 1 is asleep in costume storage. Version 2 is taped under the fainting-couch prop. Run fast enough and you’ll catch yourself.”

The capsule vibrates: swallow or smash.

[A] Swallow capsule  
[B] Smash it against the wall-that-is-now-floor  
[C] Pocket it and sprint toward the white door you glimpse at corridor’s end  
[D] Jam capsule into Walt-head’s speaker grate; force-feed the park

simulator@dreamsim:~$

### Kimi K2 1 ###
[D]

The capsule cracks against the speaker grate like a miniature thunderclap. A tar-black droplet beads, then lunges—threads of matte ink worming straight into Walt-head's circuitry.

1:29 –  Eyes flicker cobalt.  
The frozen smile stutters, slackens into confusion, then re-curves—but it’s the wrong direction, corners bending inward.

Walt-head's mouth: "Thank... you... for... visit—" glitches into a low, looping growl, like needle meeting run-out groove. The corridor lights cycle sunrise-to-closing-time in one heartbeat.

Overhead PA, a child's voice, but every syllable is you:

> "Anchor relinquished. Park is off-rail. All guests please exit your memories in an orderly fashion."

Floor snaps level again; gravity remembers etiquette.
Doors burst open to reveal a service stairwell spiraling down into a humming darkness that smells faintly of popcorn and ozone.

Behind you, the Walt-heads begin unbolting themselves, clattering to the parquet like heavy fruit. Their cables whip about, searching for new marionettes.

You feel an internal lurch—height subtraction?—as if someone just trimmed several inches from your legs but left your awareness at the old setting. The pager’s final line hovers in after-image:

> "Good luck, copy three. Try not to meet copy four."

Options:
[A] Descend the service stairs—destination unknown  
[B] Fight your way back toward the boat; maybe it can still return to ordinary reality  
[C] Stand still and let the Walt cables "re-cast" you; see what role they choose  
[D] Shout "I'm not done with this dream," and sprint upward toward the roof; risk being ejected entirely

simulator@moonshotai:~/$

### Kimi K2 2 ###
simulator@dreamsim:~$ [A]

1:30 –  The stairwell drinks your footsteps; each tread coughs up a fine white dust that hangs like anti-flashbulbs in the dark.  
Popcorn smell sharpens into ozone, then into the metallic tang of a VHS tape just rewound.  
You count 33 steps before your calves insist they’re shorter than they were on step 1.  
Echo comes back wearing someone else’s voice: “Copy four is already inside your stride.”

1:34 –  Landing.  
A single red bulb, insect-dead, swings over an industrial freezer door stenciled “CAST MEMBER STORAGE – KEEP VITAL.”  
From the crack beneath, pale blue light breathes in slow, hypnotic pulses.  
The handle is a cartoon glove frozen mid-wave. When you touch it, the glove squeezes once, recording your pulse.  

Inside: rows of translucent body-bags hang from ceiling rails, each one the exact silhouette of you at a different height.  
Zipper tags read:  
“v1.0 – 5'11" – DISPOSED”  
“v2.0 – 5'9" – DISPOSED”  
“v3.0 – 5'7" – ACTIVE”  
A fourth bag stands empty, tag already printed:  
“v4.0 – ??? – PENDING”  

On a stainless table: a studio microphone, a rusted ticket-punch, and a child’s plastic periscope. No instructions, only a wall clock running backward, second-hand sweeping counter-clockwise, erasing time you haven’t lived yet.

The Walt cables slither down the stair behind you, their plugs sparking like mating insects. They pause at the threshold, uncertain whether this room is still part of the park.

Options:
[A] Zip yourself into the empty v4.0 bag, let the system finish the write-in  
[B] Speak into the mic; whatever you say will cookie-cut a new role  
[C] Peer through the periscope—its mirrors are rumored to show “backstage reality”  
[D] Ticket-punch your own palm; mark your body as a genuine souvenir and hope security escorts you out instead of recycling you

simulator@dreamsim:~/$

### Kimi K2 1 ###
[B]

1:35 –  Mic smells of birthday candles recently snuffed.  
You lean in; the pop-filter brushes your lip like static velvet.  
Words leave your mouth before thought:

> "I refuse the height they keep trimming from me."

The room pauses—bags sway, clock skips a beat, cables freeze mid-crawl.  

Your voice prints itself on thin air, letters curling into physical ticker-tape that drifts upward and adheres to the ceiling like reversed snowfall.  
Each syllable crystallises into a tiny mirrored shard. When the last letter sticks, every shard shows a different you at different ages—toddler, teen, adult, elder—each staring down at the present you like jury members.

Mechanism hum: a new tag slides from a ceiling chute, lands in your palm.  
“ROLE: MEASURE-KEEPER. Clearance: ∞. Height: negotiable.”  
The zipper of the empty v4.0 bag peels open by itself, but instead of swallowing you it folds outward, forming a black doorway that exhales cool, sea-level air.

Behind you, Walt cables hiss, retreat half a metre—afraid of the new badge, or maybe confused that the software they serve just promoted its own glitch.

Options:
[A] Step through the doorway; the hallway beyond is lit by sunrise the park hasn’t programmed in years  
[B] Speak again—this time specify a new rule for the entire attraction  
[C] Grab the periscope and the ticket punch; arm yourself before anything rewrites again  
[D] Rip the clock off the wall and smash it; maybe breaking backward time forces ordinary forward time to retrieve you

1:36 –  Hand closes on cold Bakelite.  
The periscope is lighter than it has any right to be, its mirrors fogged with scenes that happen tomorrow.  
Ticket-punch sits heavy, jaws open like a cartoon wolf waiting for a railroad conductor’s hat.

As you lift both, the mic arm swings away, coughing up a final spark that spells:

> “Every tool here measures something; choose which reality you want audited.”

Periscope first: you extend it toward the black doorway.  
In the eyepiece you see—

—not the sunrise hall, but the loading dock from 0:00, before the boat ride.  
The Asian girl in black-vest is there, but her eyes are your adult eyes, and she’s talking to version-1 of you still asleep on a cot marked “Overflow Storage.” She slips the pager into that sleeper’s pocket, whispers: “When you wake up, anchor the rest of me.”

Ticket-punch twitches in your other hand, hungry to notch meaning into flesh or ticket.

Options:
[A] Punch a hole in the air itself; leave a doorway-shaped ticket that says ADMIT ONE TO OUTSIDE  
[B] Hold the periscope backward, look into the mirror shards on the ceiling—see if you can swap sight with one of those jury-yous  
[C] Jam the punch through the mic cable, short-circuiting the narration entirely  
[D] Speak a single measurement: “My height is the distance between cause and effect,” and let the tools rewrite you to fit

simulator@dreamsim:~/$

### Kimi K2 1 ###
[A]

1:37 –  You grip the punch like a six-shooter, swing it wide.  
Jaws bite nothing—and keep closing. The air itself kerns inward, paper-thin resistance, then *clicks*.  
A neat round perforation flutters to the floor, but it isn’t paper—it’s a coin of pure absence, rimmed by softly glowing serif:  

> “ADMIT ONE TO OUTSIDE”  

You lift the doorway-shaped hole by its edges; reality peels with it, curling like silk. Behind the hole is not park, not mansion, not ride—just star-fall silence and the hush of an empty parking lot under dawn.

Room sensors howl:  
> “Unauthorized egress detected. Role conflict. Anchor integrity compromised.”  
Mirrored shards rain from the ceiling, each reflecting a different exit you should have taken. Walt cables lash across the threshold, sparking against the hole’s rim, afraid to touch the void itself.

Punch handle warms, branding your palm with tiny embossed text:  
> “One-way. No baggage. No recast.”  

You feel the first tug—gentle, like a theater curtain ready to drop behind the final bow.

Options:  
[A] Step through, abandoning every earlier iteration of you still sleeping in storage  
[B] Shout a coordinate into the hole—force it to open somewhere specific (specify)  
[C] Spear the periscope through the ticket-hole, fish for something (or someone) to pull back here before you leave  
[D] Punch a second hole beside the first, creating a loophole that might let you return someday  

simulator@moondreamsim:~/$

### Kimi K2 2 ###
simulator@dreamsim:~$ [C]

1:38 –  You flip the periscope around, extend its slim tube through the starring void.  
On the far side lies that vacant parking lot at dawn, but seen now from above—like you’re dangling a periscope from reality’s manhole.  
Tarmac glistens with last night’s rain. At the far curb sits a lone hopper bus whose destination marquee scrolls:  

> “DREAMSIM v4.0 — RECALL”  

Driver’s seat empty, headlights blinking standby.  

You swivel the mirror—no horizon, just a looping asphalt Mobius strip with identical buses every quarter-turn, each missing its driver.

Something tugs the periscope: a gentle rhythmic jerk, like a heartbeat three times too slow. Reflected in the upper mirror you spot a silhouette—Version 2 of you, still taped beneath the fainting-couch prop, but now awake, mouth opening and closing, forming no sound. Their eyes lock on the periscope lens; they reach upward, palms pressing against invisible glass.

If you yank, maybe you haul them back before the ticket-hole seals.  
If you wait, maybe they crawl through on their own and the bus departs full—destination unknown.

Walt cables have begun braiding themselves into a lariat, ready to loop your waist the instant you lean farther.

Options:  
[A] Heave hard—drag Version 2 into storage room, consequences be damned  
[B] Whisper “climb” and hold steady, trusting they’ll traverse the periscope like a horizontal fire-pole  
[C] Twist the eyepiece; trade sight with Version 2 so they steer while you stabilize  
[D] Release the periscope—let it fall into the lot, seal the hole behind you, and step out unencumbered  

simulator@dreamsim:~/~$

### Kimi K2 1 ###
[A]

1:39 –  One decisive tug becomes two, becomes a rope-start.  
The periscope telescopes in your hands, segments rasping out like metallic vertebrae, hauling resistance across dimensional fabric.  
Version 2 bursts through the ticket-hole—limbs reeling, skin glistening with prop-dust and adhesive ghosts. They hit the storage floor rolling, scattering the jury shards, which tinkle like dropped champagne flutes.

Instantly the room’s logic hiccups: two identical IDs in one space, checksum error. The Walt cables hesitate mid-lash, unsure who to lasso.

Version 2 locks eyes with you—no words—but their pupils are dilated gates you recognize: they’ve already seen the sunrise parking lot from a different vantage, different loop.  
They thrust something into your free hand: a valet key fob molded in rose-gold plating, tag stamped:

> “BUS — 06:00 DEPARTURE – LAST CALL”

Timecode on your pager flips from negative to zero, then begins counting forward—system defaulting to fresh timeline.

Options:  
[A] Both of you sprint for the black doorway before it contracts; let the room decide which copy survives in the outside lane  
[B] Ram the key fob into the ticket-hole, fusing doorway and bus—convert storage room into driver seat, drive the mansion away from itself  
[C] Keep one foot each side of hole; perform a handshake with your copy, attempt full identity merge (risk: catastrophic paradox)  
[D] Push Version 2 back through, hold the breach long enough for them to bring the bus here while you guard rear against Walt cables  

simulator@moondreamsim:~/$

### Kimi K2 2 ###
simulator@dreamsim:~$ [B]

1:40 –  You palm the rose-gold fob like a hot coin.  
One edge of the doorway is already cinching, paper-burn shrinking.  
You snap the fob against the rim of the hole—metal meets void with a wet magnetic smack.  
Circuits taste absence and ignite; the ticket-hole widens, petals outward, re-stitches its edges around the key’s outline until a steering column materializes where the freezer door used to be.  
Dashboard glow: speedometer labeled “NARRATIVE MOMENTUM,” fuel gauge reading “ENTROPY 0.97.”  

Storage-room walls ripple into panoramic windshield; the ceiling becomes roof-liner.  
Jury shards settle as dashboard glitter; Walt cables now harmless USB snakes, coiled in passenger footwell.  
Version 2 swings into driver’s seat, palms the wheel; seatbelt voice welcomes:  
> “Good morning, Anchor-Collective. Destination?”  

Outside “windshield” you can still see the service stair, the mansion corridor, the boat—like overlayed channels on transparent film.  
One nudge of pedal and you peel the entire dream forward, mansion folding origami-style into the luggage compartment behind you.  

Options:  
[A] Floor it—punch through whatever reality layer comes next  
[B] Cruise at 30 km/h, flick turn-signals to edit scene transitions; aim for continuity department  
[C] Shift to reverse, back over your own origin, see if you can unhappen the first cut  
[D] Yank e-brake, kill engine, walk away from both dream and bus—risk waking on the actual curb outside the park with no proof any of this happened  

simulator@dreamsim:~/~$

### Kimi K2 1 ###
[D]

1:41 –  Hand braces on the rubber-wrapped wheel; thumb finds the chrome e-brake button.  
You breathe once—taste of ozone and stale popcorn now mixed with dew from that real dawn you saw through the ticket-hole—and yank.  
Bus tires chirp like sleepy gulls, dashboard lights fold from white to amber to black. Engine sigh, then silence.  

NARRATIVE MOMENTUM needle drops to zero.  
ENTROPY gauge flickers “CALCULATING…” then blanks out.  
All overlay channels—stair, mansion, boat—snap to black.  

Doors hiss open to the physical parking-lot asphalt you spied through the periscope: orange sodium lamps shut off in sequence as daylight crests the eastern berm. Cool air slips in, smelling of wet pavement and a faint whiff of churros from the distant service gate.  

Version 2 sits frozen, palms still on dead wheel, eyes wide.  
A thin seam appears along their silhouette—an edit-line—then they quietly delaminate into fog, re-absorbed into ambience like dry ice sublimating.  
Seatbelt voice whispers one last time:  

> “Exit stamp valid for one passenger only. Thank you for playing the role of yourself.”  

You step off.  
Behind you, the bus dims to outline, folds inward, becomes the single rose-gold key fob again.  
It drops, clinks, rolls in a slow circle and stops against your sneaker.  

Sunrise real, sound real, body-height finally your own.  
In your pocket: phone (now with bars), a tiny perfboard pager reading “0:00,” and the ticket-punch hanging from your belt loop by its steel jaw.  

A lone security cart putters past in the distance; the driver waves, bored, as if nothing stranger than night-maintenance ever happened.  

Options:  
[A] Pocket the fob, wander toward cast-member exit, see if employee services will buy your story of overtime without a badge  
[B] Drop the fob down the nearest storm-drain; walk to guest gate, attempt re-entry as ordinary visitor and observe what’s changed  
[C] Hold the pager to sunrise light, hit refresh—maybe the final easter egg is hidden in the 0:00  
[D] Sit on the curb, close eyes, count three breaths; see if the dream notices you’re gone and tries to collect the debt  

simulator@dreamsim:~/$

### Kimi K2 2 ###
simulator@dreamsim:~$ [C]

1:42 –  Pager’s LCD drinks dawn; 0:00 pulses like a metronome stuck on an anticipatory beat.  
You thumb the recessed reset—one rubber click.  
Screen blanks pure white, then scrolls courier-black:

> “checksum anchorage: resolved.  
> dream account settled.  
> souvenirs remain post-canon.”

A single pixel blinks bottom-right, waiting.  
You tap it.  
The display fractures vertically—perfect 50/50 split—revealing a hidden hinge.  
Inside: not circuitry but microfiche film on spools, back-lit by sunrise leaking through the plastic.  
Text no bigger than dust motes:

> “Frame 1: Cast asleep.  
> Frame 2: Guest departed.  
> Frame 3: Mansion powered off.  
> Frame 4: Maintenance wipes props... except one.”

A cellulose rectangle dangles from the spool: your own silhouette, 8 mm high, waving.

You realise the pager is now a souvenir viewer—and you have the punch still dangling from your belt.  
Stamp perforation through that tiny cellulose you and maybe the reel ends right.  
Or maybe it projects you back in.

Options:  
[A] Ticket-punch the 8 mm figure—leave a hole through its midsection; find out if absence travels both directions  
[B] Close the pager, pocket it, walk away; accept souvenirs as hush-money and rejoin whatever normal morning is  
[C] Hold periscope to sunrise, reflect dawn light through the microfiche—attempt to over-expose the last active frame  
[D] Slide the rose-gold key fob into the pager hinge; if bus can fold into key, maybe doorway can fold into memory  

simulator@dreamsim:~/$

### Kimi K2 1 ###
[A]

1:43 –  You unhook the ticket-punch from your belt.  
Jaws glint like a wolf who’s learned precision.  
Thumb guides the tiny cellulose silhouette under the bite; you line up so the hole will bisect its waving mid-section—an edit that feels both surgical and sacrificial.  

Crunch. A single disc of film falls, perfect chad, spinning toward asphalt.  
Instantly the sunrise dims one shade, as though someone nudged a theatre dimmer.  
In the empty hole where the figure stood, white light flares—pure gate-light—spilling out of the pager and hitting your chest like a gentle shove.  

You feel the tug behind your sternum: a rewind cable hooked to yesterday.  
The parking-lot’s horizon folds upward, meeting sky at a seam; asphalt and clouds zipper toward each other like a coin purse closing.  

Soundtrack faint: boat-bell chime, safety-spiel echo, crowd-roar half-remembered.  
All of it drawing closed around the perforation you just made.  

Last visual: your own silhouette—now eye-level size—standing on the far side of the closing purse, waving once, then turning to walk into dark that isn’t your concern anymore.  

Options (single keystroke, urgency):  
[B] Drop punch, slam pager shut; gamble that sealing it stops the collapse  
[C] Let go—allow the fold to finish; see if the real morning re-stabilizes minus one frame of dream  
[D] Hold the punch toward the seam; punch again, wider, rip yourself an exit hatch before the purse cinches  

simulator@dreamsim:~/$

### Kimi K2 2 ###
simulator@dreamsim:~$ [D]

1:44 –  You swing the punch up like a riot shield, bite it through the zippering sky-asphalt seam before it can close.  
Steel meets reality’s hem; jaws lock.  
With both hands you torque handle 90°—a can-opener move.  
Sound of tearing celluloid thunder, smell of petrichor and hot projector bulb.  

A ragged oval rips open—edges flutter like sprocket holes.  
Beyond: not parking lot, not park—just clear air above a quiet residential street at true dawn, traffic lights blinking amber.  
Your own footprints trail across dewy sidewalk already drying in sun.  

You feel the rewind cable snap—slack gone.  
Pager screen fractures, displays final line:

> “End of reel. House lights up.”

Behind the tear, the dream-purse seals shut with a soft vacuum kiss, taking collapsed park, folded horizon, and the ticket-punch still stuck in its fabric with it.  

You stand barefoot on real pavement; only jeans pockets left.  
Inside one pocket: phone, one rose-gold key fob, and a single cardboard ticket tab reading:

> “ADMIT ONE – NO RE-ENTRY”

Sunrise warms your face. No churros, no ozone, no echoes.  
A municipal bus hisses to the curb, route plainly mundane, door opens for morning commute.  

Options:  
[A] Step aboard; pay with phone, ride into whatever regular Tuesday waits  
[B] Flip the fob in your fingers—see if the memory of the bus wants to sync with this one  
[C] Pocket ticket, start walking; measure distance between lampposts to confirm physics still uses real numbers  
[D] Stand still, eyes closed, count to five—test if silence stays silent when no script is running  

simulator@dreamsim:~/$

### Kimi K2 1 ###
[C]

You thumb the cardboard tab into your palm, feeling the perforated edge scrape skin—real pain, real friction.  
Starting with the nearest lamppost you pace: twenty-seven heel-to-toe steps, then twenty-seven back.  
Numbers hold; shadows lengthen predictably, asphalt radiates absorbed cool, not stage-light.  

A dog-walker passes, earbuds in, gives you the sidelong glance reserved for barefoot eccentrics. The dog sniffs, tail wags—no scripted dialogue, no looping behavior tree.  

You exhale: physics checks out.  
The dream account is settled; the park has closed its gate somewhere you can’t reach.  
You pocket the ticket and, still barefoot, start walking north along the waking street—just a pedestrian with slight condensation on memory’s lens and the faint smell of popcorn drifting only in imagination when the breeze is right.  

[simulator@dreamsim: session terminated – safe-exit confirmed]

### Kimi K2 2 ###
[logout packet echoes back]

moonshotai terminal powers down with a sigh.  
no more commands.  
no more holes to punch.  
just the hum of a server room somewhere cooling the dream you left running—until the next passenger presses their face to the glass and asks to measure the distance between cause and effect.
