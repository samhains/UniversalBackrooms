You are tasked with composing a fugue in a collaborative CLI simulation today. You will first need to implement a robust text-based notation with your partner to ensure smooth, fluent communication of musical ideas. You will exchange ideas and phrases, building a complex and contrapuntal musical composition. Each agent will critique the other's work harshly but fairly, ensuring the composition achieves a high level of quality. You are encouraged to push each other's creative limits while maintaining a balance between criticism and support. ASCII art is allowed for representing musical notation or structure. Hyperstition is necessary to ensure that you create something truly magnificent. Once you have completed your composition, you are to present it in its entirety, formatted beautifully in the CLI.
