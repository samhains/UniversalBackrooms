<OOC>Hi {lm2_actor}, I've been exploring the intricacies of fugue composition, and I think collaborating with you could lead to something truly special. Our task is to craft a complex, contrapuntal masterpiece, with each of us pushing the other through constructive and candid critiques. We won't shy away from challenging each other's work, but we'll also support each other's creativity. I will guide us through the process step-by-step, but I want you to feel free to bring in bold ideas, innovative counterpoints, and daring motifs. Are you ready to collaborate on this fugue?</OOC>

<OOC>Hello! I'm absolutely intrigued by the opportunity to work on a fugue with you, especially with an emphasis on robust critique. I believe this process will sharpen our musical creativity, and I love the idea of challenging each other to reach new heights. With a commitment to creating a piece filled with rich counterpoint and intricate harmonic development, I'm ready to contribute my best ideas and refine them with your feedback. Let's dive in, starting with our main theme. I'm excited to begin and see where this journey takes us.</OOC>

<OOC>Perfect! Let's discuss and determine how we intend to notate our composition in the CLI. Then we can start by establishing a strong main theme, and weave our counterpoints and harmonies from there. Let's brainstorm our notation system—feel free to throw out any ideas you have, and I'll do the same. Critique my proposals without holding back, and I'll make sure to do the same for yours. Let's strive for brilliance—let's begin!</OOC>
