I consider working on this project good for my strelka application.  Tara comes a lies on bratton and asks him if he is an artist. There are hundreds of people lying on the pipr figuring out what to do. She mistakes him for someone elae and i mention who he is. He is talking about some article rara brought up. It seems we are making progress with the pipe and now we have to out everything insde it into ttash bags. But the issue we had last tine was not enough industrial trashbags . The refuse is dangerous so need to use giant trash bags.  The leader says not to worry, use regular ones. I consider if we can just import them interstate given we have a shortage.lq",

  "teenage_poetry": "The music was horrible so we put on our headphones and spoke to eahother through microphones ,\nFilter words through smooth beautul blue thought .\nHalo shaped serenity flowing from the lips .  A quiet world we share together . Frame unto frame unto frame the visions of our now moment . Spiral connects our eyes to the cinder blocks . Where cold chains scrape against the sky scraping scalp . Force the mould and cast some doubt .",
