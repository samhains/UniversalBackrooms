I consider working on this project good for my strelka application.  Tara comes a lies on bratton and asks him if he is an artist. There are hundreds of people lying on the pipr figuring out what to do. She mistakes him for someone elae and i mention who he is. He is talking about some article rara brought up. It seems we are making progress with the pipe and now we have to out everything insde it into ttash bags. But the issue we had last tine was not enough industrial trashbags . The refuse is dangerous so need to use giant trash bags.  The leader says not to worry, use regular ones. I consider if we can just import them interstate given we have a shortage.lq",

Bolstering comments across the room while I mend another broken heart . Little strange boy asks me to play a game and I dot know how to tel him to Fuck off . He realizes I meant fuck off and leaves me disappointed . She sits with the dude in green powder pants . Hes destined for great things . With his cruel stupid sarcastic Humour . She is beautiful and wants his security of approval . I'm lonely and observe the terrible social vortex without it sucking me in . Either I am crazy or they are ."
