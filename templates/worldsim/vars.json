  "DREAM_TEXT": "Im at a cinema and we are running late. Somehow we get there just as its starting but unfortunately theres some issue and we have to go back out and line up and fix our tickets.  I do it while mia and tara stay back.  I am quiet at the front of the line while everyone else is going crazy so the lady helps me. I make friends with these 2 guys who seem cool. One of them asks me to try on some sandals. My sandals are very old so I agree to. But i dont purchase. I head bak to theater and it seems it hasnt started yet but there is pink yoghurt which has filled the theater. For a moment I am looking down and I place seasonings above it. Some sprigs of leafs that become large indoor plants in the yoghurt."
