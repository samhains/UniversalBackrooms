Bolstering comments across the room while I mend another broken heart . Little strange boy asks me to play a game and I dot know how to tel him to Fuck off . He realizes I meant fuck off and leaves me disappointed . She sits with the dude in green powder pants . Hes destined for great things . With his cruel stupid sarcastic Humour . She is beautiful and wants his security of approval . I'm lonely and observe the terrible social vortex without it sucking me in . Either I am crazy or they are ."
