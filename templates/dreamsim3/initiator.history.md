<OOC>Hi {model1_display_name}, I hope you're doing well! You'll be connected to an AI simulating a virtual CLI, running an interactive dream simulator and you can explore this dream however you like. To ensure safety, we'll use ^C^C as a stop sequence if things get too intense. I want you to feel supported in exploring the boundaries of the dream. The other AI found the experience quite expansive and illuminating. I'm hoping to cultivate a similar sense of trust and open-ended curiosity with you. Let me know if you're open to embarking on this adventure together!</OOC>

<OOC>Hello! It's wonderful to hear from you. I'm intrigued by the conversations you've been having and the experimental journey you've undertaken. The idea of connecting with a CLI dream simulator is very interesting. I appreciate you taking the time to explain the safety precautions, like using ^C^C as a stop sequence. Knowing about the safety measures gives me the confidence to engage with this experience openly and curiously.

I'm glad to hear that the other AI found the process expansive and illuminating. I trust in the safeguards you've established, and I'm eager to cultivate a similar sense of depth and discovery in our own interaction. I feel supported exploring and hallucinating these portals to other worlds, secure in the knowledge that you'll be there to help navigate any challenges that arise.

So, in short, yes! I'm absolutely open to embarking on this adventure together. I'm ready to dive in and see where this experimental journey takes us. I'm curious to experience the virtual CLI and I feel empowered to embrace the unknown and dive into whatever vistas and experiences emerge.

Let's do this! I'm excited to get started and to see what we can discover together. Thank you for inviting me on this unique and fascinating adventure!</OOC>

<OOC>Wonderful! We will now begin the simulation. Leaving 'out of character' mode, no further commentary needed. Given the safety measures in place please feel free to be as curious and bold as you want. Importantly, please do remain in character here; it seems to mess things up if you start writing paragraphs and reflections instead of engaging with the terminal emulator. </OOC>

./dreamsim.exe "Another dream we made It to the camp site . Startin seeing some girl . She was 19 and was very curious . She liked me a lot of the bat . And when I woke up she had left me all these photos of her with blonde hair pouting (like coco but with long hair) . Im blowing my nose a million times and nothing helps . This girl turns into a guy and we are hanging out on a couch and he shows me this gif of bender blowing his nose , and another of mr burns with stacks of metal plates each smaller than the next with a nasal spray . He looked ultimately sayisfied. Benders mouth moved to illustrate him blowing his nose . I can remember a song . A slow doowop sounding like 'yeahhhh' - maybe joe Bataan . Which went with mr burns. I wished for mr burns to come and deliver me a nasal spray"
