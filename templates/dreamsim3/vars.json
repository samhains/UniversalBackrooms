  "DREAM_TEXT": "Harry didn’t die he came back to life , and I’m on a train with him. We are texting in different carriages. I ask him if he would keep using drugs after his near death experience and he doesn’t respond . I start crying and telling him that the thing I regret most in my life is not spending more time with him as an adult . And he seems moved by my words. I beg him to stop using drugs.  He says that his experience of death was pretty horrible."
