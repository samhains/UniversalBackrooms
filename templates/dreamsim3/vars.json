  "DREAM_TEXT": "I am seeing a show in a theater that is full of people. My brother is sitting next to me. The show starts. An artist with a long gown appears; she is a singer. The stage is profusely decorated: there are many red and blue lights, painted trees, iron windows. Suddenly all the lights go off and the singer starts to sing, but it seems that nobody listens to her. They all seem to be static, like dummies. Only my brother and I look at them, with amazement. We get out in a hurry, everything seems dark, the theater disappears, and I awake."
