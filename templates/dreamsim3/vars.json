  "DREAM_TEXT": "At a lecture where Paul grabowsky is talking about maple story he explains that if you use a little bit of Fungus you can populate entire floor area with mushrooms . I talk with him after and we have very earnest conversation . I go back to friends and we battle and I'm absolutely destroying them . Gets to a point where I want to use Paul's fungus spell and I forget how to do it . So I explore through the mansion looking for Paul . It's dark and late . I try an find the map and wall in room where there are instructions to use the spell . I can't seem to get there it's too dark . I see Paul but I'm embarrassingly drunk. I fall asleep in a room . I realize that the map is near and I try to wake myself up . Although I'm in some kind o sleep paralysis . I can't see anything , not even my hands . I'm trying to look at the map . I feel like someone is in te room . I'm looking for something else . I see a stack of DVDs of an interesting Australian film with dad . I want to take one . The DVD is a little square ."
