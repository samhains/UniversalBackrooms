  "DREAM_TEXT": "I’m a big warehouse and this group of people come in and take everyone hostage . They initially tell someone that they have behaved badly and punish them by killing them on the spot. They do this for a number of people. As the night progresses their motivations become vaguer and they start killing everyone without a motive. I’m terrified. At some point we have a dance party and everyone is dancing . James Daniel comes with his dad to rescue me , we get on some kind of chairlift and have a close encounter with authorities who we ultimately surpass.James dad tells us off for recklessness but we tell him we had no choice . Nobody has our name or address because we posed as someone else to get on the chairlift. Once I have escaped I tell him I feel traumatized , horrified . That followed a similar arc to the nazis where to begin with there was a vague rationale but by the end it was just an excuse for mass killing."
