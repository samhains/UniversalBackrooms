  "DREAM_TEXT": "Go to a restaurant with my dad and brother for my birthday celebration when I’m back in Melbourne I don’t invite Paris lensky to the dinner but he picks me up afterwards and takes me to the beach. I tell Paris I’m unreasonably excited about going for a swim. I feel bad about not inviting Paris to the dinner and consider making up an excuse. Harry is at the beach and we all smoke weed together it’s really fun. Harry looks heavily under the influence of drugs and I wonder for a second if he has been using but then I consider that perhaps it’s just he is highly effected by drugs. There is a large pot of boiling water that my dad suggests I drink. Before we leave dad points out that we should visit Harry’s plaque I don’t want to go there but dad makes a speech I cry."
