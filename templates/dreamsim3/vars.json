  "DREAM_TEXT": "Had a dream that I met david rudnick and Michael oswell. He came over to my house and I had put the cover of an sphere twin album cover inside my mouth so I was trying to retrieve it. It was like this webbing that covered my mouth. When I went inside my mouth there were all these little slices of it. I actually had a vision inside my stomach as a huge cavern and all the purple and green clippings were there . I managed to pull them out . Which is good because I considered I could die if they all fell in my stomach. They didn’t seem edible I had misunderstood what the cover was for. Michael had a wife that he was talking about which was strange because I thought he was gay. I told him that he once responded to me on Twitter about autechre. The cover was a green and purple jester hat that fitted over it. I played the album for Michael and he was like. Damn that’s fire. Then There was smoke all of a sudden in the room and it seemed like a good time for Michael to leave . Seemed some kind of virtual system fixed the problem. Said it was the cheese and chicken pasta. There was no cheese and chicken pasta. I am a little disturbed by the power of the surveillance that was in our home that we don’t know about yet. Clearly google have way more power than they let us know as The fact they were able to shut down a fire like that without anyone even arriving was crazy ."
