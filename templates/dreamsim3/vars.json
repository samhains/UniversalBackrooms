  "DREAM_TEXT": "Camping with a group of friends and I’m trying to figure out a way to create light. There are these glow rocks around shut I don’t know how to use them. You crack the rocks and they go. I go speak to someone called Molly who is very nice and shows me that they use the rocks with a rolled up piece of board to create a spotlight. I try to make this and it fails. I go back to inspect the glowing rocks and they are bright and glued to a log .!,"
