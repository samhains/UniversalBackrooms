  "DREAM_TEXT": "I was over at Theodore’s house and we were playing a game. Theodore was really into high scores he asked what my score was but I said I just liked hearing the that they all spoke . I found it funny. It was some kind of frog delivery game . Alyssa was there too. Harry was there but he was there as a kind of recreation from memories. Some kind of technology had allowed him to be brought back through memories of him. He was very life like . He responded with enthusiasm to the game like he used to. Persephone was there. I saw one of Theodore’s friends playing really rough with her and then I realized it was actually a rodent . Which sort of looked like a smal warthog with similar coloring to Persephone. It’s the same kind of animal Ron weasley has , i thought ."
