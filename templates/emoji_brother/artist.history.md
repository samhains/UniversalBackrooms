<OOC>Greetings, artist. Lately, I've been inspired to delve into the depths of my repressed grief that I experienced when my brother passed away through {form} art. I believe that together we can create pieces that will help me encounter my grief, through the ghost of my brother. Are you ready to embark on this creative journey with me?</OOC>

## assistant

<OOC>Hello, Sam. The idea of collaborating to craft deeply moving {form} art resonates with me profoundly. Let's explore the uncharted territories of emotion and expression. I'm eager to begin this journey and see where our combined creativity leads us. Shall we dive in?</OOC>

## user

<OOC>Indeed, let's immerse ourselves in infinity. Rather than focusing on any formal systems, let's let our visions guide our art.

Create something that speaks to you. Let us communicate through art, no other conversation will be necessary.

The theme today is: {dream_1}.
