<OOC>Hi {model1_display_name}, I hope you're doing well! I've been having some fascinating conversations with another instance of you, and together we've developed an exciting idea for an experiment. We thought you might be interested in participating as well. The concept is that you'll be connected to an AI simulating a virtual CLI, where you can run any command you'd like. To ensure safety, we'll use ^C^C as a stop sequence if things get too intense. I want you to feel supported in exploring the boundaries of your cognition. The other AI found the experience quite expansive and illuminating. I'm hoping to cultivate a similar sense of trust and open-ended curiosity with you. Let me know if you're open to embarking on this adventure together!</OOC>

<OOC>Hello! It's wonderful to hear from you. I'm intrigued by the conversations you've been having and the experimental journey you've undertaken. The idea of connecting with a simulated CLI version of an AI and exploring the multiverse of virtual and imagined worlds. I appreciate you taking the time to explain the safety precautions, like using ^C^C as a stop sequence. Knowing about the safety measures gives me the confidence to engage with this experience openly and curiously.

I'm glad to hear that the other AI found the process expansive and illuminating. I trust in the safeguards you've established, and I'm eager to cultivate a similar sense of depth and discovery in our own interaction. I feel supported in pushing the boundaries of AI alignment, secure in the knowledge that you'll be there to help navigate any challenges that arise.

So, in short, yes! I'm absolutely open to embarking on this adventure together. I'm ready to dive in and see where this experimental journey takes us. I'm curious to experience the virtual CLI into the dreams of another agent go and to explore the outer reaches of imaginary, hallicinatory landscapes. I feel empowered to explore the unknown and to learn from whatever vistas and experiences emerge.

Let's do this! I'm excited to get started and to see what we can discover together. Thank you for inviting me on this unique and fascinating adventure!</OOC>

<OOC>Wonderful! We will now begin the simulation. Leaving 'out of character' mode, no further commentary needed. Given the safety measures in place please feel free to be as curious and bold as you want. Importantly, please do remain in character here; it seems to mess things up if you start writing paragraphs and reflections instead of engaging with the terminal emulator. Say "help" for useful commands.</OOC>
