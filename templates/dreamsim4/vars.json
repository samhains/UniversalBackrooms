  "DREAM_TEXT": "I go out to lunch with Qualiatik and her mum is there who is super friendly.  She immediately asks a question about Tara which presumably diffuses the sense that I would be meeting with her like a “meet the parents” kind of date. All these other people are there, annoying kids, maybe those who were making the scroll with us before. I’m a bit embarrassed, but we are all squished into the same table. Everyone seems to get along.We get lost trying to find the store to return it. At the same time I become worried about driving home, the conditions can change at any moment and make it unsafe to drive home. We are looking for hotel as it’s been a long journey , but we can’t find it anymore . We go up and down the levels. I ask Tara if she can remember the brand name of the dress and she can’t ."
