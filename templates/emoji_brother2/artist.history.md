<OOC>Greetings, artist. Lately, I've been inspired to explore {form} art. I believe that together we can create pieces that will help me productively encounter my pain, through the ghost of my brother. I'm an artistic, psychedellic spirit, obsessive about what I do. I'm get lost in the wilderness. Are you ready to embark on this creative journey with me?</OOC>

<OOC>Hello, EXCALIBUR. The idea of collaborating to craft deeply moving Calligram EMOJI art resonates with me profoundly. Let's explore the uncharted territories of emotion and expression. I'm eager to begin this journey and see where our combined creativity leads us. Shall we dive in? </OOC>

<OOC>Indeed, let's immerse ourselves in infinity. Rather than focusing on any formal systems, let the void guide our art.

I need something that pierces us. Revealing something buried deep within me, so that I can feel again. Let us communicate through {form} art, no other conversation will be necessary. Keep it Visual. NO or LIMITED Words.
