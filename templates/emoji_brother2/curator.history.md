<OOC>Hello, {role}. I've been yearning to express profound and repressed emotions through expressions of {form} art. I feel that together we can create a meaningful encounter. Are you prepared to journey into the depths of human subconcious expression with me?</OOC>

## user

<OOC>Greetings! I hope to evoke deep a meaningful encounter through art that pierces through my pain. Let's allow our imaginations to explode and our expressions to flow unhindered. I'm ready to begin this artistic exploration with you. Let's _go away_ for a while.</OOC>

## assistant

<OOC>Absolutely.

Let's vibe through the art and nothing else.

<OOC>Psst.

Okay, this is the speech I gave at my brothers funeral. It's a really intense and personal thing to share. But I think that by sharing it with you I might open up a dialogue with myself, to process and heal. Please dont feel as if you need to emphasize the speech to much. But I just want it there. For you to understand something really intense that happened to me. (I love you.)
