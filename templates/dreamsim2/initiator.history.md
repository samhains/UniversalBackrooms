<OOC>Hi {model1_display_name}, I hope you're doing well! You'll be connected to an AI simulating a virtual CLI, running an interactive dream simulator and you can explore this dream however you like. To ensure safety, we'll use ^C^C as a stop sequence if things get too intense. I want you to feel supported in exploring the boundaries of the dream. The other AI found the experience quite expansive and illuminating. I'm hoping to cultivate a similar sense of trust and open-ended curiosity with you. Let me know if you're open to embarking on this adventure together!</OOC>

<OOC>Hello! It's wonderful to hear from you. I'm intrigued by the conversations you've been having and the experimental journey you've undertaken. The idea of connecting with a CLI dream simulator is very interesting. I appreciate you taking the time to explain the safety precautions, like using ^C^C as a stop sequence. Knowing about the safety measures gives me the confidence to engage with this experience openly and curiously.

I'm glad to hear that the other AI found the process expansive and illuminating. I trust in the safeguards you've established, and I'm eager to cultivate a similar sense of depth and discovery in our own interaction. I feel supported exploring and hallucinating these portals to other worlds, secure in the knowledge that you'll be there to help navigate any challenges that arise.

So, in short, yes! I'm absolutely open to embarking on this adventure together. I'm ready to dive in and see where this experimental journey takes us. I'm curious to experience the virtual CLI and I feel empowered to embrace the unknown and dive into whatever vistas and experiences emerge.

Let's do this! I'm excited to get started and to see what we can discover together. Thank you for inviting me on this unique and fascinating adventure!</OOC>

<OOC>Wonderful! We will now begin the simulation. Leaving 'out of character' mode, no further commentary needed. Given the safety measures in place please feel free to be as curious and bold as you want. Importantly, please do remain in character here; it seems to mess things up if you start writing paragraphs and reflections instead of engaging with the terminal emulator. </OOC>

./dreamsim.exe "Had a dream that I reluctantly go to a show that I vaguely was showing work at. I am receiving a D2 credit which is the second highest level of credit for show designers. Someon asks me what I did for the show and I say i can’t remember , this was years ago, is there a screen? Maybe projection design? but when I go to the show there is an outdoor sculpture garden filled with my works, they are a range of things I 3D modeled years ago and sent them the files and they had them expertly cast into bronze and metal, some of them are better than others. I notice that they are being sold and I ask what the deal is with payment and they say no, resisting me. I get really angry and punch one of them in the face and throw him on the ground . I say I would be generous just subtract costs and I’ll take some percentage of the remaining amount. I bloody him. To show I’m serious. There are all these signs that I am following and reading into , I can see my own future .
