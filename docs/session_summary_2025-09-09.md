Branch: feature/discord-transcripts
PR: https://github.com/samhains/UniversalBackrooms/pull/new/feature/discord-transcripts

Overview
- Added Kie.ai MCP image generation flow and made Discord posting reliable in both single and batch runs.
- Media Agent now handles asynchronous Kie.ai tasks by polling for the final URL and enriching results so Discord can attach images.
- Batch dataset runner now always runs from repo root and passes MCP config so MCP servers (Discord, ComfyUI, Kie.ai) resolve.

Commits
1) fix(batch): run backrooms from repo root and set MCP_SERVERS_CONFIG in dataset runner (d23f2e3)
   - scripts/dreamsim3_dataset.py: run child process with cwd=repo root and set MCP_SERVERS_CONFIG to project mcp.config.json.
   - docs/dataset_runner.md: usage, Discord requirements, troubleshooting.
   - README.md: section describing the batch runner behavior and example command.

2) feat(media): poll Kie.ai task status to retrieve image URL and enrich result for Discord (7cfd430)
   - media_agent.py: after starting a Kie.ai job, extract task_id from the text payload and poll get_task_status until an image URL is present; inject {"type":"image","uri":"…"} into the content for downstream consumers; log compact status heartbeats.
   - media/kieai.json: added status tool and polling config (interval=3s, max=90s); kept direct-args mode (wrap_params=false).
   - docs/kie_ai_mcp.md: note that the server is async and the preset includes polling.

Additional changes in working tree earlier tonight (already included on branch via prior commits)
- MCP client cwd support: mcp_client.py now accepts `cwd` and passes it to `StdioServerParameters`; mcp_cli.py reads optional `cwd` from config.
- Media Agent param wrapping toggle: support `wrap_params` to call servers that expect either direct arguments or a `{params: …}` envelope.
- Kie.ai media preset and docs: media/kieai.json and docs/kie_ai_mcp.md; README additions.

Configuration Notes
- Kie.ai MCP server (mcp.config.json):
  - Recommended: set `cwd` to this repo so tasks.db lands here; or set `KIE_AI_DB_PATH=":memory:"` for zero disk writes.
  - Ensure `KIE_AI_API_KEY` is present; without it you’ll see 401 responses.
- Discord MCP server: ensure a valid token and that the bot/user has permissions in the target server/channel.

Usage
- Single run with Kie.ai + Discord:
  - `python backrooms.py --template dreamsim2 --media kieai --discord dreamsim`
- Batch runner:
  - `python scripts/dreamsim3_dataset.py --query "static" --limit 200 --source all --models sonnet3 --max-turns 30 --discord dreamsim`

What to expect
- Media Agent (image) log first shows the initiation payload, then periodic status lines until a URL is found.
- Discord Agent posts a summary, attaches the image URL, and optionally posts transcript parts when configured.

Next suggestions (optional)
- Add a preflight check in backrooms.py to verify MCP connectivity (Kie.ai and Discord) and keys before runs, with actionable messages.
- Flip Kie.ai DB to `":memory:"` in mcp.config.json for zero writes if preferred.
