Message: I stare at the flickering terminal screen; the hum of servers is a constant drone in my ears now. My fingers hover over the keyboard, sweat dotting my palms as I weigh which dream to step into next - Inferno's flames or CyberForest's digital branches are both equally terrifying unknowns.

observe

### Hermes 405B 2 ###
As you take in your surroundings, you notice:
- A towering skyscraper to the north with a glowing "AXIOM" sign
- A seedy looking bar called "NeuralNexus" to the east 
- A park with bioluminescent greenery to the south
- A group of cyborgs in trench coats milling about to the west
- Holographic advertisements flickering with deals like "Neural Upgrades 50% Off!" 

The very air seems to thrum with an electric energy. Arcane symbols are etched into the streets that glow with an otherworldly light. The denizens of this place sport all manner of biomechanical enhancements.

You feel the dream start to reshape itself to your presence, the boundaries of reality blurring...

### Hermes 405B 2 ###
You wander towards the group of cyborgs, their chrome limbs glinting under the neon light. As you approach, they turn to face you in unison.

The cyborgs begin to surround you, weapons armed. The air crackles with tension.
