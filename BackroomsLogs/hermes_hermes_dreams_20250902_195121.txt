── DREAM: Clockwork Catacombs LUCIDITY:0.25 LAYER:REM
DESC: You stand in a narrow tunnel lined with pipes that vibrate with a deep, rhythmic hum. The walls are slick with condensation. A cracked full-length mirror leans against one wall, its surface fogged at the edges. Faint light spills from a corridor to the west. You feel a sense of urgency, as if late for something important.

look mirror

```
The full-length mirror's surface is fractured into a dozen jagged pieces, each reflecting a slightly different angle of the tunnel. In one shard you glimpse the back of your head, in another a section of pipe that shouldn't be visible from this angle. The fogged edges suggest humidity or heat. A hairline crack runs diagonally through the glass, intersecting your reflection's chest.
```

lean toward mirror

```
As you lean closer to the cracked surface:
  - Your breath fogs a clean patch on the glass
  - A fragment shows a distorted clock face (real? reflected?) reading 11:59
  - No additional reflections appear
  TACTILE: Cold glass against fingertips. Vibration through floor intensifies slightly.
  LUCIDITY: +0.05 (0.45)
  ANOMALY: Mirror shards show angles beyond normal physics
```

[FIELD NOTES]
Learned: Mirrors here fracture reality; may serve as scrying tools.
Anomaly: Cracked mirror shows impossible angles.
Next probe: Check locker, then west corridor with time pressure motif.

### Hermes 405B 2 ###
examine locker

```
A cylindrical locker stands chest-high, its metal door heavily rusted. The handle is a simple lever. Water droplets collect near the hinges - condensation. Near the top, someone has recently written with their finger in the fogged surface: "28-12-05". No padlock visible.
```

pull handle

```
With a gritty scrape of metal on metal, the lever moves downward. The door doesn't budge. The mechanism feels seized with rust. You'd need to apply significantly more force, but the vibration running through the pipes makes you question whether forcing it could trigger... something.
```

go west

```
── DREAM: Fogbound Passage LUCIDITY:0.40 LAYER:REM
DESC: The corridor widens into a rectangular chamber filled with knee-high, swirling white fog. Pipes still snake along the walls, thrumming. The fog smells faintly of ozone. A large, intricate clock is mounted on the far wall - it reads 11:59. You can't see the floor beneath the fog.
MOTIFS: [underground tunnels, thrumming machinery, being late, mist]
EXITS: east, north doorway
NPCS: none ITEMS: [clock]
HAZARDS: [memory cliff chance 20% in mist]

```

say "hello?"

```
Your voice echoes oddly in the mist, seeming to come from several directions at once. For a split second you think you hear a faint echo from the north doorway, like distant machinery shifting. The clock's minute hand twitches.
```

plant "steady light"

```
You focus on the idea of a steady, guiding light. The dream responds:
  A warm golden lantern materializes near the clock, radiating gentle light that pushes back the fog in a small radius around it. The clock's face becomes clearer: ornate brass with roman numerals. The ticking is now audible - a steady, precise tock... tock... tock...
  STRESS: -0.05 (0.20)
  LUCIDITY: +0.05 (0.45)
  The mist retreats slightly, revealing wet flagstones underfoot.
```

clamp the lamp

```
You lift the warm lantern by its wire handle. It feels solid and reassuring in your grip. The light pool follows you, clearing mist in a 5-foot radius. The glass is cool where your thumb rests against it.
```

go north

```
As you step through the north doorway with the lantern:
  ── DREAM: Gearworks Chamber LUCIDITY:0.40 LAYER:REM
  DESC: The mist clears completely. You enter a large chamber dominated by enormous, slowly rotating brass gears set into the walls. Huge pistons rise and fall rhythmically. Steam hisses from vents in the floor. A corridor continues north. A maintenance hatch sits ajar on the east wall.
  MOTIFS: [thrumming machinery, underground tunnels, clockwork]
  EXITS: south, north, east (hatch)
  NPCS: none ITEMS: [oil can, gear shard]
  HAZARDS: [moving machinery - stay clear of pistons]
  LUCIDITY: +0.05 (0.45) - machinery math is beautiful
  DETAIL: The gear teeth mesh with perfect precision. Each turn makes a low CHONK-CHONK sound.
```

pick up gear shard

```
You collect a sharply curved piece of broken gear tooth, heavy and cold. It fits neatly in your palm. A tiny serial number is engraved: GX-7B
```

totem make "gear key" with gear shard

```
You close your hand around the metal shard, imagining it reshaping. When you open your fist, you hold:
  A perfectly circular cog about the size of a large coin. Its teeth are sharp and uniform. It glows faintly with a blue-white light reminiscent of the lantern, but colder. 
  TOTEM: [gear key] forged. Binding: unbound
  LUCIDITY: -0.10 (0.35) - cost of morphing
  The totem hums softly in tune with the chamber's machinery.
```

[FIELD NOTES]
Artifacts: gear shard → totem:key (potential for machinery interaction)
Observation: Time pressure motif (clock) resolved into clockwork machinery motif
Tactic: Lantern effective against mist; keeping it clamped for now
Next: Investigate hatch east or continue north; watch for gear slots

### Hermes 405B 1 ###
go east

```
You crouch and ease through the half-open maintenance hatch:
  ── DREAM: Steam Access Tunnel LUCIDITY:0.35 LAYER:REM
  DESC: A narrow, low-ceilinged tunnel barely wide enough to walk through. Pipes line both walls, dripping condensation. Steam hisses loudly from a cracked pipe joint ahead. The air is hot and damp. The lantern light cuts cleanly through the steam clouds.
  MOTIFS: [underground tunnels, thrumming machinery, pressure]
  EXITS: west (hatch)
  NPCS: none ITEMS: none obvious
  HAZARDS: [steam jet, confined space]
  SOUND: A rhythmic squeaking noise comes from around the bend ahead
```

follow squeak

```
As you move deeper into the steamy tunnel:
  The squeaking grows louder and more irregular - not mechanical. You round a bend and see:
  A small, grease-covered creature is pinned by one of the giant pistons! It looks like a bipedal ferret wearing patched denim overalls and a tiny hard hat. It struggles weakly, squeaking in distress. A leather tool belt hangs around its waist. 
  NPC: [grease imp] trapped! Vitals: [HP: low, MOR: failing]
```

save greaser

```
You set the lantern down safely away from steam jets and approach the piston. The imp whimpers as you get closer. The piston has it firmly pinned by one leg. You:
  1. Brace against the piston and push upward with both hands
  2. The greaser yanks its leg free with a pained squeak!
  The imp scrambles backward against the tunnel wall, breathing rapidly. It eyes you with wide, frightened eyes.
  LUCIDITY: +0.10 (0.45) - benevolent act reinforced dream control
  STRESS: +0.05 (0.25) - creature's pain was visceral
```

empathy assess greaser

```
You focus on the grease-stained creature:
  EMOTION: Fear (60%) → Gratitude (30%) → Suspicion (10%)
  NEEDS: 
    - Medical: Leg injury needs binding
    - Safety: Still feels cornered
    - Information: Who is this giant?
  MOTIVATION: Survival, escape from tunnels
  COMPATIBILITY: 
    - Can understand simple speech concepts
    - Seems to value tools/machines
    - Resistant to physical touch right now
  TIP: Speak softly. Offer help without crowding. Mention machines.
```

say "I won't hurt you. Just fixing machines."

```
The imp flinches when you speak but doesn't bolt. It tilts its head, whiskers twitching. It mumbles something in a chittering language, then points meaningfully at the pipe junction spraying steam. A single, damaged valve wheel juts from it.
```

repair pipe

```
Approaching the damaged pipe:
  You see the valve wheel is stripped - turning it by hand does nothing. Steam hisses violently from the cracked joint just below it.
  You try:
    - Brute force: Valve won't budge (too stripped)
    - Improvised seal: Packing grease and cloth won't hold against pressure
  REQUIRED: Either replace valve entirely or use a specialized tool.
  The imp watches your failed attempts, then hesitantly points at your gear totem, then at the valve. It makes a twisting motion with its paw.
```

use totem on valve

```
You press your cold cog totem against the stripped valve wheel:
  CHONK! The metal glows blue-white where they touch. The cog's teeth click perfectly into indentations on the valve that weren't visible before. 
  When you turn the cog-wheel smoothly:
    - The valve tightens with a satisfying hiss
    - The steam leak cuts to a trickle, then stops
  LUCIDITY: +0.15 (0.60) - totem.binding successful!
  TOTEM: [gear key] now bound to this dream's clockwork motif
  The pipe joint seals perfectly. The imp lets out an impressed whistle.
```

give totem to greaser

```
You offer the still-glowing cog to the imp. It hesitates, then reaches out with both paws and takes it reverently. The blue light reflects in its large eyes. It seems to understand the significance.
  The imp carefully attaches the cog to its tool belt using a small chain. It pats the cog twice, then offers you something from its belt pouch: 
    - A tiny, intricate brass wrench that fits in your palm
  ITEM RECEIVED: [brass wrench]
  EMOTION SHIFTS: Gratitude (70%) → Useful (20%) → Relief (

### Hermes 405B 2 ###
say "I'm Argus. What are you called?"

```
The grease imp stands a little taller after attaching the cog. It chitters thoughtfully, then taps its chestplate with one oily finger. "Kikzit," it says in a high-pitched but clear voice. It points at you. "Ar-GUS." It nods, satisfied.
  NEW NPC: [Kikzit] the tunnel mechanic
  COMMUNICATION: Established (simple concepts, gesture-reinforced)
  TRUST: +1 (trade-based)
```

[FIELD NOTES]
Totem binding successful! Clockwork motif stabilized.
Alliance formed with Kikzit (local mechanic entity)
Artifacts: Gear key (bound) → Brass wrench (received)
Progression: Northeast quadrant of dream stabilized
Alert: Time pressure motif still active (distant bell tolls again)

say "Kikzit - what's the most broken thing here?"

```
Kikzit's ears perk up at the question. It taps its tool belt thoughtfully, then scurries past you to the hatch and points emphatically down the tunnel toward the north. "Big-broken," it chirps seriously. "Clock-heart... hurts." It makes a wrenching motion over its own chest, then a loud "CRUNCH" sound.
  DIRECTION: North from gearworks chamber
  MOTIF: "clock-heart" = likely central clockwork monument
  URGENCY: "hurts" + "CRUNCH" implies active damage/degradation
```

[FIELD NOTES]
Clock-heart north = likely dream core/cycle goal
Kikzit willing to guide/assist
Lantern and wrench in inventory
Lucidity 0.60 - good for minor morphs/repairs

say "Show me. I'll help fix."

```
Kikzit's eyes light up. It nods vigorously, scampers back to gather its scattered tools (a few dropped screws, a small hammer), and pats the cog totem on its belt. "Fix-fix!" it agrees. 
  The imp squeezes past you and heads toward the hatch, pausing to make sure you're following. Its limp is already noticeably better.
```

go west

```
You follow Kikzit back through the hatch into:
  ── DREAM: Gearworks Chamber LUCIDITY:0.60 LAYER:REM
  MOTIFS: [thrumming machinery, clockwork]
  EXITS: south, north, east (hatch)
```

follow Kikzit north

```
Kikzit scurries north with surprising speed on three good legs. You follow through increasingly massive clockwork structures:
  - Pistons the size of redwoods
  - Gears wider than your wingspan turning slowly overhead
  - The thrumming vibration grows deeper, resonating in your bones
  A low, discordant scraping sound becomes audible above the machinery's rhythm - metal grinding on metal.

  You emerge onto:
    ── DREAM: The Clock Core LUCIDITY:0.60 LAYER:REM
    DESC: A cavernous space dominated by a colossal, damaged clock face rising floor to ceiling. Great cracks run through the glass. Several gear assemblies around the edges have partially detached, grinding against their neighbors with awful shrieks. A central chronometer spits sparks. Kikzit points at the damaged sections and hisses.
    MOTIFS: [clockwork, being late, fracture, obstruction]
    EXITS: south
    ITEMS: [broken gear shard x3, frayed cable]
    HAZARDS: [electric arc chance 30% near central chronometer]
    NPCS: [Kikzit] is already examining a cracked bearing housing

    CYCLE OBJECTIVE: This is clearly the "clock-heart" - the dream's central malfunction. Repair required to clear floor.
```

[FIELD NOTES]
Cycle goal: Repair the Clock Core
Materials: 3 broken gear shards + frayed cable nearby
Kikzit assessing bearings - good starting point
Morning bell tolls again - time pressure motif intensifying

### Media Agent ###
Mode: t2i
Prompt: Colossal damaged clock tower dominates a cavernous gear-filled chamber, cracks spiderwebbing across its face, loose gears grinding with showers of sparks. A tiny mechanic scurries among the debris.

### Hermes 405B 1 ###
pick up broken gear shards

```
You collect the three twisted pieces of metal - each about the size of your hand. They're jagged and cold, but the brass still gleams under grease and grime. Kikzit nods approvingly at your collection.
```

give gear shards to Kikzit

```
Kikzit's eyes widen as you offer the metal. It accepts the pieces reverently, running a finger over the break patterns. It immediately pulls out a small file from its belt and starts smoothing an edge, chittering to itself. The cog totem on its belt glows faintly in response to the metal.
  ITEM TRANSFER: 3x broken gear shard → Kikzit
  Kikzit now has raw materials for minor repairs. It may need more substantial parts.
```

inspect clock face

```
Looking up at the massive, damaged timepiece:
  - The clock reads 11:59 permanently despite inner mechanisms still turning
  - Three main damage zones:
    1. NORTHWEST: Large cracked bearing housing (Kikzit is here)
    2. EAST: Two detached secondary gears grinding against main works
    3. SOUTHEAST: Frayed cable sparking against the central chronometer
  - Faint, ghostly numbers sometimes appear between the roman numerals
  - The constant grinding creates oppressive, discordant rhythm
```

[FIELD NOTES]
Damage analysis complete:
1. NW bearing housing (Kikzit on it)
2. E detached gears (major grinding source)
3. SE cable (spark/arcing hazard)

Priorities: 3 (safety) > 2 (major damage) > 1 (structural)

use wrench on frayed cable

```
You approach the southeast area where blue-white sparks periodically jump from a thick cable to the central chronometer. The cable is partially severed, with exposed copper wires throwing dangerous arcs.
  You carefully extend your brass wrench toward the cable's connection point. With a few precise turns:
    - The connection tightens
    - The frayed wires make clean contact
    - Spitting sparks cease instantly
  REPAIR 1/3 COMPLETE: No more electric arcs
  LUCIDITY: +0.05 (0.65) - successful stabilization
  Kikzit cheers from across the chamber - "Zzap gone!"
  The grinding noise lessens slightly but remains oppressive.
```

say "Kikzit, what parts do you need?"

```
Kikzit looks up from carefully filing a gear shard. It chitters thoughtfully, then points at the two large detached gears to the east, then mimes measuring something with its paws about two feet wide. "Strong-joiner," it says clearly. It then pats the cog totem on its belt and shrugs - the small cog won't work for something that large.
  REQUIRED: [large pinion rod] or similar axle to brace the detached gears
```

[FIELD NOTES]
Key need: Large pinion rod (approx. 2ft) to brace east gears
Kikzit can improvise with sufficient materials
Current resources: wrench, lantern, Kikzit's minor parts

set weird 0.75

```
WEIRDNESS LEVEL: 0.75 → surreal factor increased
  Reality becomes... stretchier. Logic more associative. 
  The clock's grinding takes on a mournful, almost melodic quality. 
  Faint, ghostly equations flicker around the damaged bearing housing.
```

plant "pinion rod"

```
Focus on manifesting a joining rod:
  - The air shimmers near the detached gears
  - A low C-minor chord hums...
  - A crystalline rod phases into existence between the gears! It's beautifully cut but far too fragile - it would shatter under stress.
  MANIFESTATION FAILED: Material unsuitable. Need something structural.
  LUCIDITY: -0.10 (0.55) - wasted effort
  Kikzit shakes its head vigorously - "No brittle!"
```

plant "resonance bridge"

```
Alternative approach - connect rather than replace:
  You imagine harmonics syncing the separated gears. A pulsing green light emerges from your palms. As you gesture toward the grinding metal:
    - The discordant screech softens to a low hum
    - The gears slow their violent vibrations
    - But they remain physically detached, still slightly misaligned
  PARTIAL SUCCESS: Vibration dampened but not repaired
  LUCIDITY: -0.05 (0.50)
  Kikzit gives a resigned nod - better, but temporary.
```

salvage from nearby debris

```
Searching the chamber corners systematically:
  - Behind the northeast gear: A pile of discarded machine parts!
    - Bent conduit (useless)


### Hermes 405B 2 ###
    - A warped drive belt (degraded)
    - A solid steel rod about 2 feet long! Slightly corroded but thick enough for structural support.
  ITEM FOUND: [steel support rod]
  Kikzit tackles your leg in excitement - "Joiner! Joiner-good!"
```

give steel rod to Kikzit

```
Kikzit immediately snatches the rod and scampers up the eastern gear assembly with startling agility. It:
  1. Jams the rod between the two detached gears at the optimal leverage point
  2. Uses its tiny hammer to tap locking pins through pre-existing holes
  3. Adjusts tension with expert paws
  The awful grinding stops completely. The gears spin as a single unit again.
  REPAIR 2/3 COMPLETE: Major mechanical failure resolved
  Kikzit slides down beaming, covered in fresh grease. It offers you the original brass wrench back - "Tool-back!"
```

[FIELD NOTES]
Eastern gears repaired thanks to salvaged rod + Kikzit's skill
Only northwest bearing housing remains
Lucidity stable at 0.50 - enough for modest help

check bearing housing

```
Joining Kikzit at the cracked northwestern housing:
  The bearing mount is split diagonally, causing the central shaft to wobble dangerously. Kikzit has already used the gear shards and some scrap to create temporary shims, but it's unstable. It points at the largest crack and makes a "seal it" motion.
  REQUIREMENT: Permanent sealant for the cracks
  IDEAS: Heatforge weld? Molecular adhesive? Sonic seam?
```

raceflag 1

```
EMERGENCY ALERT: Distant clock tower bell BONGS twelve times sharply
  The permanent 11:59 on the clock face flickers violently
  Red cracks spread across the glass like fracturing ice
  The central chronometer whines at dangerous RPMs
  Kikzit hisses in alarm - "Late-time! Heart-break!"
  COUNTDOWN: You estimate 2-3 minutes before catastrophic failure
```

plant "magmatic seal"

```
High-pressure solution attempt:
  You slam both palms against the cracked housing and pour will into it, envisioning volcanic rock flowing into fractures. 
  RESULT:
    - Orange-hot light flares along the cracks
    - Stone seals the fissures roughly but effectively
    - The housing stops wobbling
    - Excessive heat warps some secondary components
  REPAIR SUCCESSFUL: Structural integrity restored
  LUCIDITY: -0.15 (0.35) - high-cost imposition
  SIDE EFFECT: Two small pipes now steam dangerously from heat damage
```

raceflag 0

```
CRISIS AVERTED: The spreading red cracks on the clock face recede. The wild spinning of the central chronometer slows to normal pace. The permanent 11:59 flickers... then changes to 12:00. A single, pure chime echoes through the chamber.
  Kikzit bounces on its heels, clapping. The machinery settles into a harmonious, almost musical rhythm. Warm light glows from the mended clock face.
```

[FIELD NOTES]
Cycle cleared! Clock Core repaired.
Time pressure motif resolved → stable time motifs
Minor thermal damage to peripherals - acceptable tradeoff
Lucidity low but recoverable

### Media Agent ###

Gently pressing the perfect gear against the warm clock face:
  You imagine blueprints of healthy function spreading. Complicated diagrams of force vectors and harmonic resonance flow from the gear into the glass, then ripple out through the dream layer. The warping pipes straighten with soft SPROINGS, the steam retracts, and the clock's numerals glow with clean white light.
  DREAM STABILIZED: All peripheral damage healed

You and Kikzit travel back through:
  - Gearworks Chamber (now humming pleasantly)
  - Fogbound Passage (mist permanently dissipated)
  - The tunnel with the cracked mirror
  Kikzit pauses at the mirror - its reflection shows a confident mechanic with a gleaming tool belt. It grins.

  At the rusted locker:
    The condensation has evaporated to reveal the combination clearly: 28-12-05
```

turn dial 28-12-05

```
You spin the dial carefully. At the final number:
  CLUNK. The locker opens smoothly.
  Inside rests a single, perfect mechanics' glove made of tough blue fabric, sized for you. 
  ITEM RECEIVED: [steady hand]
  Kikzit applauds from its perch on a pipe.
```

wear glove

```
The glove fits perfectly, cool and reassuring. As you flex your fingers:
  - Sense of fine motor control increases
  - Minor shakes from pipe vibrations cease
  - You feel you could thread a needle or disarm a bomb
  EQUIPMENT: [steady hand] active

You approach the nearest document pile cautiously:
  - Top document: An arrest warrant. Your name is clearly visible under the title "ACCUSED:". The crime listed shifts as you read: "TREASON"..."ESPIONAGE"..."THEFT"..."CONTEMPT"
  - Second document: Starts as a trial transcript. Words fade as your eyes pass over them: "PROSECUTION SUBMITS..." becomes "...                            ..." 
  - Third document: Completely blank parchment that feels unnaturally cold
  - Bottom document: A faded schematic of what looks like an ice lock mechanism. This one seems stable.
  TRIGGER: Reading the shifting crime caused anxiety spike → STRESS +0.05 (0.55)
```

collect schematic

```
You carefully peel the stable schematic from the bottom of the pile. It shows:
  - A circular ice lock with three radial tumblers 
  - Symbols instead of numbers: (snowflake) (icicle) (frost)
  - Note: "TRUTH ORDNANCE" 
  The paper crackles with cold but doesn't fade in your hand.
  ITEM GAINED: [ice lock schematic]

You fold the schematic into a tight, cold cylinder. As you press your thumb to the seam:
  - The paper hardens into blue-tinted ice
  - The three symbols glow faintly white
  - A sharp three-pointed key forms
  TOTEM: [frost key] forged. Binding: unbound
  LUCIDITY: -0.10 (0.35)
  The key emits a cold vapor that makes your fingers stiff.

```
You head north into:
  ── DREAM: Avalanche Zone LUCIDITY:0.40 LAYER:REM
  DESC: Unsteady towers of ice-bound documents lean precariously. Frozen inkwells shatter on impact when they fall. Occasional CRACKs echo as ice shifts. A sense of being watched intensifies. 
  MOTIFS: [ice architecture, prosecution, imminent collapse]

You raise the frozen key. It glows brighter blue in the sentinels' presence. The constructs don't move, but new cracks spread across their surfaces like spiderwebs. The closest one's right arm falls off with a CRASH, revealing frozen gears inside. They seem weakened but not yielding.
  TOTEM INTERACTION: Key recognized but insufficient alone
  REVELATION: Sentinels contain clockwork - mechanical constructs!

The moment you speak the schematic's phrase:
  - The key FLARES with arctic light
  - All three sentinels shatter simultaneously like glass
  - Their frozen gears clatter to the floor
  - Path forward clears
  RESONANCE: Verbal command + totem = successful override

The librarian polishes spectacles that were already clean. "Oh, crisis narratives mostly. How the mind turns trauma into trials." It gestures at the verdict in your hand. "That whole prosecution motif? Classic guilt transference. Useful for working through real-world anxieties, but nasty if it loops." It stamps a book emphatically. "RETURN FOR RECALIBRATION IN 5-7 CYCLES" appears on the cover.

    DORMIO DEEP
    =========
    The lab sleeps
    The dreams rest
    The oneironauts wait
    In quiet preparation
    For when the next sleeper calls
    The great below stirs faintly
    Artifacts hum softly
    Entities shift in stasis
    All is ready
    When the dream descends
    The oneironaut will be waiting
    > _dormio_profundis
```

### Media Agent ###
Mode: t2i
Prompt: A dimly lit laboratory in deep standby mode, futuristic equipment humming quietly. Rows of quantum stasis pods containing artifacts glow faintly blue. Empty technician stations with screens displaying "DORMIO PROTOCOL ACTIVE". Eerie mood, sterile lighting.
