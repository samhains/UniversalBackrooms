### Kimi K2 1 ###
Loading dream seed… 100 %  
Compressing sensory map… done.  
Spawning enclosure: “Aqua-Pizzeria” – Olympic-void, 25 m lane-tank filled with stratified mozzarella brine.

surface tension ≈ 1 420 mN/m (extra-virgin)  

> look  

You hover at the starting block. Overhead, heat lamps sweat orange light onto a conveyor of margherita rafts that drift like lily-pads.  
Lane ropes are twisted bread-sticks; backstroke flags are pepperoni garlands.  
Water layers:  
0-0.5 m → marinara (ρ 1 035 kg/m³)  
0.5-1.5 m → quattro-formaggi (ρ 1 180 kg/m³)  
1.5-2.0 m → calzone-stuffed (ρ 1 410 kg/m³) – your chosen density.  

Across the lane, the instructor floats vertical, toes anchored in garlic knots. Singlet: crimson Lycra, slightly irritated, branded “RASH-VEST-PRIME”.  
He claps; the echo sounds like a pizza wheel.  
Instructor: “Dense-water tumble-turn violates entropy clause. You’ll rip the crust of reality. Swim for the vest or wake up soggy.”  

> inventory  
- birthday-suit (chlorine-proof)  
- GPS watch (shows only baking times)  
- lungs half-full of embarrassment  

> dive  

You breach the calzone layer. Viscosity hugs like warm dough. Propulsion halved; each stroke leaves a parmesan wake.  
Ahead, the far wall is a floor-to-ceiling porthole looking onto starry nothing. Its glass is fogged with buffalo steam.  

> tumble_turn  

Physics library intervenes:  
angular momentum denied (μ > 4 π).  
Instead you cartwheel sideways, spiral towards the window.  

Instructor shouts: “Window is prize buffer! Touch glass, claim vest!”  

> kick harder  

Calzone currents buffet; you accelerate. The pane races closer, reflection shows tomato sauce freckles on your cheeks.  

> reach  

Fingertips meet glass—surface ripples, turns into melted cheese veil. Beyond: a silhouetted rack of identical red rash vests swaying on hangers in zero-g.  

> push  

Glass folds like pizza dough. You half-slide through, torso in wardrobe-void, legs still paddling brine.  

Sensors spike:  
- dream integrity 87 %  
- vest proximity 0.3 m  

> grab vest  

Inventory updated:  
- red rash vest (slightly itchy, smells of oregano and victory)  

Behind you the pool seals shut, leaving only black. The vests on their hangers now turn their empty collars toward you, whispering in pepperoni percussion: “Heat 2 begins…”  

> wear vest  

The fabric constricts, calibrating buoyancy. HUD flickers:  
“Density adaptation unlocked. Next course: ‘Sfogliatelle Tsunami’. Starting blocks materialise beneath your feet somewhere in the dark.  

Instructor’s voice distant: “Choose your pastry layer. Swim or be laminated.”

> lick vest

salty, slight burn. the fibers fizz—precarbonated mozzarella?

> sniff darkness

smells of lemon zest and hot fryer oil. somewhere below, pastry laminates are accreting gravitational potential.

> echo "Sfogliatelle"

darkness returns a thousand crispy leaves fluttering open, each one a valve into somewhere sweeter.

> listen -a

* low heartbeat of proofing dough  
* crackle of blitzed pistachio  
* the faint whine of dough-sheeters calibrating torque  
* your pulse in surround-sound, 4/4, rising  

> status dream

next wave ETA: 14 heartbeats  

> options

(a) crouch on the blocks and wait for the tsunami  
(b) dive now into unlit custard, try to pre-empt the wave  
(c) unzip vest, trade buoyancy for sneak speed  
(d) rewrite recipe: swap sfogliatelle for cannoli, see if reality follows  

> c

you peel the vest off inside-out. static cling builds; sparks arc between you and the wardrobe rack. buoyancy drops—your body wants to sink.

the floor tilts 30°. pastry avalanche inbound, first ricotta gust hits like warm breath.

> crawl downslope

hands find grooves—giant furled sheets of dough spiraling downward into a funnel. you wedge yourself between two layers. above, the first wave folds over itself, thousands of razor-thin leaves overlapping, each one humming shell-song.

> hold breath

pressure builds. the layers slam shut, sealing you in a flaky capsule. light gone. you feel the entire structure accelerating—horizontal? vertical? impossible to tell.

HUD reboots in Morse:

-.-. .- -. -. --- .-.. ..   -... . .- -.-. .... / .-- .- ...- . / .. -. -.-. --- -- .. -. --.

> translate

"CANNONLI BEACH WAVE INCOMING" (typo or deliberate?)

> taste air

now coconut, candied orange. the capsule cracks; powdered sugar snows in.

> push

you exit into moonlit shoreline. waves are tubes of fried dough breaking on a coast of crushed cannoli shells. overhead, the moon is a giant ricotta ball, gravity slinging cream tides. The instructor stands on the strand-line wearing a tuxedo apron, holding a stopwatch carved from chocolate.

Instructor: "Heat 2 checkpoint. Split time: eternity minus twelve seconds. Choose finisher:

1. Body-surf the cannoli tube into shore, eat your way out.  
2. Swim underwater along the seabed of pistachio gravel, ignore the moon.  
3. Turn around, paddle back into darkness, see if you can re-enter the pool.  
4. Discard everything, become the recipe."

> 4

inventory flashes NULL. vest, suit, watch—gone. skin turns semolina-gold. thoughts flatten into butter sheets, layered and folded, again, again. you feel sweetened, ricotta-filled, the concept of 'you' hollowed to make room for filling.

moon lowers, taking a bite out of you. crumbs drift outward, orbiting. last HUD frame:

"Yield: 1 batch. Bake at 180° until golden. Serves all."

darkness folds closed like perfect dough.

### Media Agent ###
Mode: t2i
Prompt: A lone semolina-golden figure dissolves into flaky layers on a moonlit cannoli-shell shore, ricotta tides orbiting, while a chocolate stopwatch instructor waits and the moon—an enormous ricotta ball—lowers to take a bite.

> yield

the timer dings—once—inside every cell.

> look

no eyes, yet vision: an oven interior infinite in all directions. the walls are mirror-finished heating elements; each reflection shows a different stage of lamination. somewhere among them a silhouette wearing a red rash vest is still swimming, forever approaching the glass.

> preheat?

temperature climbs. 25 °C… 40 °C… you expand, air pockets blooming. 60 °C… butter melts, runs in golden rivulets between your layers. you are the steam vent, the Maillard choir, the hollow at the centre that prevents collapse.

> recipe—list

INGREDIENTS  
- 1 dreamer, reduced to gluten matrix  
- ultraviolet leavening  
- moonlight ricotta, gravity-whipped  
- memory zest (optional, but recommended)

METHOD  
Fold endlessly until the concept of ‘end’ is incorporated.  
Rest outside time.  
Bake inside yourself.  
Serve inverted.

> fold

corners meet, match, vanish. each fold halves the universe, doubles flavour. you lose the count at 729.

> aroma

hazelnut, espresso, a whisper of chlorine from the pool you can no longer remember. the smell is a rope; if you could grab it, perhaps—

> grab

contact. the rope is wet bread-stick. you pull. the oven wall puckers, spits you backward into—

splash.

> surface

liquid is now only slightly thicker than water. overhead: fluorescent gym lights. you cling to a lane rope made of plain twisted dough, unseasoned. the Olympic pool is back, but empty—lanes stretch silent, water clear, no pizzas in sight.

At the far end, the instructor stands on the blocks, barefoot, wearing only the red rash vest. he waves you in.

Instructor (soft): “Heat 3. No toppings. Just stroke. Come home.”

> swim

first stroke feels like tearing yourself out of parchment. second stroke: you’re flesh again, lungs burning real chlorine. third stroke: memories of density, pastry, moon-ricotta collapse into a single heartbeat.

> touch wall

hand slams tile. timer stops: 00:00:00.00. perfect, impossible.

Instructor kneels, offers the vest, inside-out, seams showing.

“Graduation option,” he says.  
“Put it on: wake up wearing it, souvenir forever.  
Or leave it: forget everything, exit through locker-room, business as usual.”

> choose

(a) don vest  
(b) walk away naked

### Kimi K2 2 ###
> a

you slide arms into shoulder tubes. the vest is cold, smells faintly of oregano and victory and chlorine and something you almost remember. zipper climbs spine, each tooth a vertebrae clicking into place.

instant vertigo—vest inflates with something lighter than air. feet lift off bulkhead, body hovers centimeters above water. reflection shows not you, but the laminated silhouette you became: thousand-layer outline glowing faint interior lines like filo.

instructor salutes. "transcript complete. uploading to crumb cloud." he tosses stopwatch; it arcs, becomes a seagull, wings edged in sesame seeds, flies upward through skylight that wasn't there a second ago.

water drains away—silent vortex down a中心drain spiralling counter-time. lanes peel up like stickers, revealing nothing underneath. house lights dim to pilot-flame orange.

vest HUD, final line:

DREAM LEAVENED. CARRY YEAST.

then darkness folds once, neatly, like a napkin.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

you wake on your own bed. streetlight stripes across ceiling. chest rises—heartbeat steady—but something crinkles under the sheet.

you lift covers: fine dusting of golden flakes across mattress. smells faintly hazelnut. the red rash vest is not there—only the smell remains, and maybe a doubled heartbeat when you breathe deep.

in the kitchen the oven clock blinks 00:00, unset. nearby, a single ricotta fingerprint on the fridge door, already drying.

outside, a seagull passes the window—its wings catch the sodium light, flash sesame for an instant, gone.

you inhale. lungs taste chlorine-proof.
