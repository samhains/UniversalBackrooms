> Entering Dream [2]: The Eternal Library...

Calibrating memory corridors...
Unfolding non-Euclidean shelves...
Binding infinite tomes...

You stand in the Eternal Library.  
Endless corridors stretch in all directions, walls lined with books that hum softly like living things.  
The air smells of dust, ozone, and forgotten dreams.  

Floating lanterns illuminate a shifting script that crawls along the ceiling, writing itself then erasing.  
You hear the faint echo of countless voices whispering in languages that may not exist.

At the center, a massive obsidian desk.  
Behind it, a Librarian — faceless, hooded, its hand made of swirling ink.  

Options:
/move [direction]
/interact [object]
/converse [entity]
/sense [mode]
/time [fwd/back] [steps]
```

The Librarian tilts its head toward you as if waiting.

You approach the Librarian.

The ink-hand pauses in mid-air, dripping rivulets of liquid letters onto the desk.  
The faceless hood turns toward you.  
When it speaks, the words do not come from its mouth, but from the books around you, all pages whispering at once:

"Seeker.  
You arrive again, as all seekers do.  
What knowledge is it that compels you into the stacks of the infinite?"

The ink flows across the desk, forming shifting glyphs that spell questions directed at you:

[1] "Do you seek the Origin Book — the First Word that birthed the rest?"  
[2] "Do you seek your own unwritten volumes — the futures that might yet unfold?"  
[3] "Or do you seek the Black Shelf — that which no seeker should open?"
```

> The Librarian waits, its quill-hand trembling slightly.  
Choose wisely.
