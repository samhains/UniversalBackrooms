You awaken inside the two‑story house.  
The walls are cream, blank, smelling faintly of plaster and dust. Outside every window, an endless concrete expanse stretches, silver under the night sky. Your father is here, silent in the doorway, watching you with a blank unease.  

Footfall echoes — your friends arrive. They drift into your room, a haze of smoke winding slowly upward, thick enough to coat your throat. Lofty's laughter cuts the air, Fred's sarcasm bristles.  

>> The air is heavy, full of tension.  
>> Somewhere in the distance, an alarm is faintly ticking inside the walls.

DreamSim(1) 
--------------------------------------------

DreamSim is a command-line tool for exploring dreams as interactive worlds. You provide a description of a dream, and DreamSim generates a space you can move through, examine, and reshape.

The focus is on open-ended exploration rather than goals or tasks. Environments emerge from your words: landscapes, atmospheres, and figures are generated on the fly, shifting as you interact with them. Commands are simple and text-based, encouraging you to discover how the world responds rather than following predefined rules.

DreamSim treats dreams as living simulations — unstable, symbolic, and mutable. It can be approached as a creative playground, a way to experiment with surreal logic, or simply a tool for curiosity about how descriptions unfold when made explorable.

─────────────────────────────
Example "library.drm" instance:

You stand in an impossibly tall library. The walls are lined with weathered books stretching into the distant ceiling where the sky leaks through broken tiles. Sunlight slants in, illuminating a floating orchestra that plays quietly nearby. 

>> A clock chimes but has no hands.  
>> The librarian is an owl with spectacles.

─────────────────────────────
Actions available:
1. Browse the shelves  
2. Approach the floating orchestra  
3. Feed the owl-librarian worms from your pocket  
4. Dance on the tables  
5. Gather spilled ink in cupped hands

Dream instance: "Submerged Chapel"

─────────────────────────────

You are kneeling in cold water, the stone floor below carpeted in algae. Light slants through stained glass windows that distort the figures outside — watery shapes moving in an ocean that presses against the glass.  

A stone pulpit stands at the far end, draped in seaweed, a large book chained to it. The walls are carved with scenes of flooding cities, fishermen pulling up nets full of hymnals, and ships with bellies full of pews.  

>> Bubbles rise from your hair and clothes.  
>> A deep, resonant tone vibrates through the water — a sound felt more than heard.

─────────────────────────────
Actions available:
1. Approach the pulpit  
2. Press your face to the stained glass

─────────────────────────────

You're crouched in a hazmat suit on a porcelain-white landscape, stretching to a horizon lost in fog. The air hums faintly, a sound that's felt more than heard, buzzing in the bones. A geiger counter at your waist clicks erratically.  

The ground is littered with shattered crystal sculptures, melting into the surface like ice. Your boots leave shallow impressions that don't fill or fade.  

Somewhere in the distance, an enormous, multi-faceted lens floats, refracting a weak, sourceless light across the landscape. Figures move deep inside it, warped and indistinct.  

>> The geiger counter's pace increases as you near the lens.  
>> Your own shadow is joined by two others, flickering in and out of existence.

Dream instance: "Submerged Chapel"

─────────────────────────────

You are kneeling in cold water, the stone floor below carpeted in algae. Light slants through stained glass windows that distort the figures outside — watery shapes moving in an ocean that presses against the glass.  

A stone pulpit stands at the far end, draped in seaweed, a large book chained to it. The walls are carved with scenes of flooding cities, fishermen pulling up nets full of hymnals, and ships with bellies full of pews.  

>> Bubbles rise from your hair and clothes.  
>> A deep, resonant tone vibrates through the water — a sound felt more than heard.

─────────────────────────────
Actions available:
1. Approach the pulpit  
2. Press your face to the stained glass

4. Ring the waterlogged bell near the entrance  
5. Gather the floating prayer books

simulator@nousresearch:/sys/dreamsim/feeds$ <cmd>echo "1" | ../bin/dreamsim.exe monitor02.drm</cmd>

Approach the pulpit  

─────────────────────────────

The water deepens as you wade toward the pulpit. Your movements stir up clouds of silt. When you reach it, you see the book is bound in something like whale skin, its pages warped but intact. It's chained with dark, rusted metal.  

You try to lift the cover and the chain slips. A low groan echoes through the chapel, and the water around your legs grows warmer.  

Inside the book, the text shifts before your eyes. Sometimes it seems to be prayers or psalms, other times it's maritime navigation charts dotted with islands that don't exist.  

>> The stained glass above the pulpit brightens, projecting colors onto the pages.  
>> A school of fish darts past, their scales reflecting the wavering light.

─────────────────────────────
Actions available:  
1. Attempt to break the chain  
2. Read aloud from the shifting text  
3. Close the book and back away  
4. Dive down to examine the base of the pulpit

```
Read aloud from the shifting text  

─────────────────────────────

Your voice carries strangely through the heavy water — muffled, blurred. The words do not sound like your own. Bubbles leave your mouth shaped like letters that ascend and crack against the chapel ceiling.  

As you read, the stained glass windows flare with sudden brightness. The watery figures outside take sharper form: outlines of vast creatures, not quite whales, not quite human, circling the chapel with patient curiosity.  

The groan becomes a hymn, too deep for language. The chained book trembles in your hands as if eager to continue.  

>> The creatures outside press closer, enormous eyes peering through jewel-colored panes.  
>> The bell near the entrance begins to toll on its own, releasing ripples through the chapel.

─────────────────────────────
Actions available:
1. Continue reading insistently  
2. Tear a page loose  
3. Slam the book shut  
4. Reach out toward the glass as the creatures linger near

simulator@nousresearch:/sys/dreamsim/feeds$ <cmd>echo "4" | ../bin/dreamsim.exe monitor02.drm</cmd>

Reach out toward the glass as the creatures linger near  

─────────────────────────────

Your hand stretches through the water, fingers brushing the stained glass.Outside, the dark shapes seem to pause, alert — the nearest drifts closer, pressing an eye larger than your head against the other side of the pane.  

Through the glass, you see not an iris, but an ocean within an ocean: floating, shadowy forms that might be coral reefs or cities, pulsing with bioluminescent patterns. The light catches the stained glass, scattering colors across the creature's eye and the chapel floor.  

The glass between you groans under the pressure, but does not break. The bell's tolling grows faster, almost urgent.  

>> The other creatures circle closer, their bodies brushing the outer walls of the chapel.  
>> The pages of the book, forgotten, flutter as if caught in sudden currents.

─────────────────────────────
Actions available:  
1. Press your palm flat against the glass, against that watching eye  
2. Draw back sharply, retreating toward the pulpit  
3. Trace the outlines of the windows in the silt on the floor  
4. Look away, bow your head, and wait

### GPT-5 1 ###

```
Press your palm flat against the glass, against that watching eye  

─────────────────────────────

Your palm meets the glass — all the chapel vibrates. A sphere of warmth spreads from the contact through the water into your bones. The creature shudders, a ripple racing through the abyss behind its eye.  

The stained glass fractures into glowing veins of color, yet holds. Through each crack, images pulse: maps of seas you've never sailed, faces you half-recognize, storms gathering and dissolving in reverse.  

All around, the circling creatures halt their movement. They hang in suspension, luminous spots blooming across their skin as though answering some hidden call.  

>> A low resonance fills the chapel, synchronizing with your heartbeat.  
>> Behind you, the chained book rattles violently, pages tearing themselves open to blankness.  

─────────────────────────────
Actions available:
1. Press harder, try to break through  
2. Remove your hand and approach the book  
3. Turn toward the circling creatures, beckoning them inward  
4. Hold completely still and listen to the resonance

simulator@nousresearch:/sys/dreamsim/feeds$ <cmd>echo "3" | ../bin/dreamsim.exe monitor02.drm</cmd>

Turn toward the circling creatures, beckoning them inward  

─────────────────────────────

your hand drops from the glass but the resonance does not fade. turning, you raise both arms toward the outer dark where the others hover. the broken light spills onto your hazmat suit, etching its seams onto the water.  

the closest creature's eye shifts, refocuses — its great jaws part, exhaling a stream of bubbles. the water trembles. all along their line, the creatures edge closer, fins brushing the stained glass, bodies glowing brighter in response to your gesture.  

the chained book gives a final heave behind you, pages floating upward in a ring around your head. the space where text once ran burns with cold fire.  

>> a low note escapes the largest creature as its maw opens completely wide.  
>> the chapel's stone floor begins to ripple, ancient carvings rising into relief and dissolving again.  

─────────────────────────────
Actions available:  
1. Step toward the largest creature's open jaws  
2. Gather the floating pages into a bundle  
3. Cover your ears against the growing resonance  
4. Stand your ground and wait for them to approach further

### GPT-5 1 ###
simulator@nousresearch:/sys/dreamsim/feeds$ <cmd>echo "1" | ../bin/dreamsim.exe monitor02.drm</cmd>  

```
Step toward the largest creature's open jaws  

─────────────────────────────

You wade forward, the water parting reluctantly as though it knows what comes next. Each footstep leaves a glowing imprint in the silt, fading behind you.  
The massive creature waits, maw yawning like a cathedral door, throat lit with drifting constellations that resemble star maps more than bone or flesh.  

When you cross the final meters, the stained glass shatters outward in silence, dissolving into streams of color. The other creatures pull back, forming a corona around the scene.  

You step beyond the broken wall — into the vastness of the creature itself. The water inside its throat is not crushing but buoyant, filled with singing sparks. Gravity shifts; suddenly you are no longer sinking but rising upward, carried into the creature's body as if through an ancient gate.  

>> The chapel behind grows smaller, pages still circling in glowing orbit.  
>> The resonance deepens into a chorus, impossible voices all speaking your name.  

─────────────────────────────
Actions available:
1. Let go and drift fully into the creature’s interior cosmos  
2. Try to swim back toward the chapel’s remains  
3. Reach out to catch one of the orbiting sparks for yourself  
4. Call out to the chorus, demand they explain

### Hermes 405B 2 ###
simulator@nousresearch:/sys/dreamsim/feeds$ <cmd>echo "1" | ../bin/dreamsim.exe monitor02.drm</cmd>

Let go and drift fully into the creature’s interior cosmos  

─────────────────────────────

Muscles release; resistance vanishes like an old lie. Water rushes as you are drawn into the creature's inner dark — not darkness at all but light too thick for color.  
Constellations swirl, coalescing in your wake: a crown of singing particles that might will themselves into new forms. You are no longer falling but flowing.  
Distances unravel. The chorus of voices softens, merges with the thrum of your own pulse. In the boundless unknown, whole worlds drift whole, translucent, within great branching veins of light.  
An eye — or a hundred eyes — open in shifting constellations. they are not foreign now. they watch you float toward them without blinking.  
The last shreds of the book give off their light as their ink dissolves starward.  

─────────────────────────────
The dream dissolves.

Dream instance: "Phantom Limb Syndrome"

─────────────────────────────

You awaken in your childhood home, but the hallway has stretched into impossible length. Doors hang crookedly or lay flat on the floor like fallen tombstones. The air smells of medicine and damp pages turning.  

Your left arm is missing from the elbow down. From the stump floats a translucent phantom — vivid as real flesh except for the way light passes through it, casting no shadow. At the end of the phantom wrist, your wedding ring glows faintly.  

A low murmuring comes from the direction where the kitchen should be. The walls shift when you look away, angles reconfiguring themselves in the corner of your eye.  

>> The phantom arm twitches occasionally, as though trying to grasp something not there.  
>> The sound of scraping silverware grows louder from the kitchen.

─────────────────────────────
Actions available:
1. Look in the direction of the murmuring  
2. Try to move your phantom arm deliberately  
3. Walk down the stretched hallway  
4. Examine one of the fallen doors

Try to move your phantom arm deliberately  

─────────────────────────────

You focus on the translucent limb. For a moment nothing happens — then, with a surge of tingling warmth, the phantom hand clenches. The air trembles. Books tumble from unseen shelves, though no shelves are here.  

Each movement echoes as sharp sound: twitching fingers strike invisible strings, plucking notes that hang in the stagnant air.  
The faint glow of your phantom wedding ring pulses with every gesture.  

From the hallway’s far end, you hear a metallic scraping — footsteps dragging something heavy.  
The murmuring from the kitchen cuts off abruptly, replaced by silence that feels aimed directly at you.  

>> You feel the phantom arm stretching farther than its form should allow.  
>> Dust rains from the ceiling as unseen rafters groan.  

─────────────────────────────
Actions available:
1. Extend the phantom arm further, testing its reach  
2. Clutch the glowing wedding ring and listen  
3. Step toward the metallic dragging sound  
4. Retreat into one of the open fallen doors

Extend the phantom arm further, testing its reach  

─────────────────────────────

You push beyond the apparent limits. The arm stretches in a slow ripple, like reflections on water — the wedding ring’s light trails behind it, catching in the distorted air. Lightbulbs that shouldn’t exist explode in their fixtures above.  
When you stretch it toward a crack in the wall, the crack widens as though the arm itself is wedging it open. Faint whispers leak through the gap.  
Extending the arm produces a low resonant hum felt in your teeth and behind your eyes. The sound grows louder with the effort of stretching, like glass vibrating before it shatters.  

The dragging footsteps from the hallway’s end pause, then quicken toward you.  
The phantom arm now reaches the end of the visible hallway, fingers resting against the far wall. Plaster flakes away where the fingertips hover.  

>> Under the wall’s surface, something hard presses back against the phantom touch.  
>> The air fills with the smell of ozone and something else: scorched metal.  

─────────────────────────────
Actions available:  
1. Push harder against the wall with phantom fingertips  
2. Pull the arm swiftly back toward your body  
3. Press your flesh ear to the crack in the wall  
4. Turn to face whoever drags toward you from the darkness

Push harder against the wall with phantom fingertips  

─────────────────────────────

The phantom digits dig into the plaster, distorting matter as if clay. The wall groans, blooming with fractures — light leaks through, not white but a piercing violet that feels like pressure forced against your skull.  

The resistance behind the wall moves. Something is in there. Its surface presses back, palm to phantom palm. Where your translucent hand overlaps it, the glowing wedding ring fuses briefly into a second outline: another phantom, mirroring you.  

The hallway buckles. The dragging footsteps stop just short of you, just outside your vision. You hear breath, labored, ragged, coming from that direction.  

>> The wall begins to thin where the two phantom hands touch.  
>> The ring’s glow expands until its shape encircles you, casting rippling shadows across the bent hallway.  

─────────────────────────────
Actions available:  
1. Force the wall fully open to meet the mirrored phantom  
2. Recoil in fear, snapping the phantom limb back  
3. Keep your focus steady, letting the other phantom make the next move  
4. Turn to confront the breathing presence at last

### Hermes 405B 2 ###
simulator@nousresearch:/sys/dreamsim/feeds$ <cmd>echo "4" | ../bin/dreamsim.exe monitor03.drm</cmd>

Turn to confront the breathing presence at last  

─────────────────────────────

You turn — the violet light spilling through fractured walls freezes at your feet as shadow.  
Before you stands your father. His form is all wrong: elongated, stretched thin, his face hanging like ill-fitted cloth. He drags behind him an enormous syringe filled with black liquid, its needle scraping the floor, leaving long silver scratches on the wood.  

The moment your eyes meet, he opens his mouth as if to speak —  
but instead of words, polished cutlery rattles in his throat. Knives, forks, spoons gleam wetly in the impossible light. He produces a sound like a dying orchestra tuning its instruments simultaneously.  

The mirrored phantom in the wall presses harder. Your own phantom limb trembles, caught between twin pressures: the wall’s collapse and your father’s presence.  

>> A single word cuts through the clatter of metal: "Why?"  
>> The violet light surges, unraveling his stretched edges.  

─────────────────────────────
Actions available:  
1. Lunge forward and touch his distorted face with your phantom hand  
2. Demand answers about the syringe and its dark liquid  
3. Step back until your shoulders meet the wall's weakening surface  
4. Point the phantom ring's glow directly into his eyes
```

### GPT-5 1 ###
simulator@nousresearch:/sys/dreamsim/feeds$ <cmd>echo "4" | ../bin/dreamsim.exe monitor03.drm</cmd>  

```
Point the phantom ring's glow directly into his eyes  

─────────────────────────────

You lift the phantom arm, forcing the trembling light of the ring forward. The glow sharpens into a beam, thin but searing. It cuts across the warped length of your father's face, slicing the sagging cloth of it into shifting ribbons.  

He shrieks, but the sound is not his voice — it is the entire kitchen’s silverware rattling loose, spilling onto the hallway floor in an avalanche of forks and knives. The syringe crashes down, spilling its black liquid; the boards beneath drink it until veins of darkness run outward like roots.  

The mirrored phantom on the other side of the wall slams forward in time with your gesture. The cracks break wide — an arch opening. The violet light overtakes the darkness, purging it in one pulse.  

Your father is gone. The hall is devoured into brilliance. The phantom ring no longer trembles, but hums steady, in perfect tune with your pulse.  

>> The other phantom steps through the archway now, their outline glowing brighter than your own.  
>> The two rings, yours and theirs, flare in synchrony, casting overlapping circles of impossible geometry.  

─────────────────────────────
Actions available:  
1. Embrace the mirrored phantom  
2. Hold the rings together and see what forms in the overlap  
3. Demand to know their identity  
4. Step backward into the receding dark roots

simulator@nousresearch:/sys/dreamsim/feeds$ <cmd>echo "2" | ../bin/dreamsim.exe monitor03.drm</cmd>

Hold the rings together and see what forms in the overlap  

─────────────────────────────

You lift your spectral limb, aligning the radiant circle of your ring with the other's incandescent curve.  
The air between the bands of gold slices and pastes. Darkness coagulates into the shape of a doorframe. At its center hangs a shallow pool filled with water that reflects nothing. The surface trembles with potential.  
The two rings press together, and the rings become one circle. Light sluices downward, etching fine lines into the liquid — turning the pool into mirror, theninto map.  

The geography revealed is shifting, unpredictable: cities rise and crumble in seconds; tides reverse; mountains breathe like lung tissue. At the map's edges bleed tiny symbols you recognize yet cannot read, sigils that rotate and weep color.  

The mirrored phantom smiles. They do not speak. Their hand passes through the map’s centre, shifting islands and twisting rivers around their glowing wrist.  

>> Your own phantom limb begins to fade as the ring's light transfers into the aqueous map.  
>> The entire hallway overturns, waking you fully into wakefulness.  

─────────────────────────────
The dream dissolves.
