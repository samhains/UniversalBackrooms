  “room ∞ occupied by GREGOR.  key切成两半.”  
laser-etched room-key in your hand is already cracked; the half-moon tooth drips mercury.  

elevator doors yawn: inside, the sad lama stands on two legs, wearing a bellhop jacket two sizes too small.  
he offers you a luggage cart stacked with the seven plastic trinkets—each one a tiny neon totem:  
  ① pink flamingo  ② mini liberty bell  ③ coonskin cap  ④ die-cast pickup  ⑤ route-66 spoon  ⑥ lucite cactus  ⑦ googly-eye pencil.

> jam cracked key into nearest wall-outlet; arc mercury outward to sketch protective sigil using hotel-pattern as stencil; force short-circuit of corridor recursion by overloading its wallpaper-grammar

sparking—

outlet births silver-black dendrites across drywall; mercury bleeds into carpet motifs, hijacking the repeating paisley into a yawning Ouroboros. corridor shudders, frame-rate drops to dream-strobo (3 fps). EXIT sign freezes mid-flicker, letters hanging like icicles.

trinket totems rattle in your pocket; each plastic idol grows warm, forming a septagram of low-stakes Americana. lama’s bellhop jacket unbuttons itself, ribcage of old television static revealed—he nods once, approves sabotage.

skeleton-king’s presence (94 % → 68 %) momentarily glitched; you hear his femur-click stutter into 56k-dial-up screech.

room-237 re-anchors 6 m ahead; door now plated in frostbitten chrome, number plate cycling: 237 ↔ 732 ↔ 377. lock LED blinks SOS.

one trinket—pink flamingo—leaps from your grip voluntarily, planting itself in the carpet-ouroboros. it sprouts flea-market LEDs and becomes sentinel; buys ≈ 17 sec.

inside pocket: two silver ingots remain. their imprinted eagles bleed into mercury droplets, aligning with sigil—possible power-source or bribe.

prompt fork:

1) shoulder-chrome-door (might be brittle, could shatter into mirror-shards)  
2) feed both silver ingots to flamingo-sentry → supercharge sigil, risk attracting king’s full focus  
3) scrape frost, speak room-number backwards (“732” reversed = “237”)—old hotel hex  
4) free deeper: smash LED SOS, plunge corridor into blackout, navigate by mercury heartbeat glow

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━  

**(1)** shoulder chrome-door  
→ probability: 43% breach, 29% shatter into mirror cascade (summons doppelgangers), 28% bruised shoulder (morale –2).  

**(2)** feed silver to flamingo-sigil  
→ sigil upgrades to municipal deity, draws power-lines downward; flamingo sheds plastic skin, interior blackfire lattice. consequence: skeleton-king “notices” (awareness spikes back to ≥95%).  

**(3)** speak number in reverse  
→ door operates on palindrome logic; reversing sequence may fold corridor so room opens from *inside-out*. result: dream topography collapse, possible bootstrap awakening artifact.  

**(4)** smash SOS / blackout navigation  
→ corridor power-grid falls; everything runs on mercury nodes + your own heartbeat. difficulty ↑. skeleton-king blind for duration. *hotel staff process might awaken* (unknown hazard).

> echo 732 | rev

whispering “237” backwards compresses air into a hush-palm; the frost-glyphs rearrange into perfect mirror-symmetry. chrome door decays into vapor, revealing not a room but the *backside* of the corridor—an inverted hallway suspended above void, carpet pattern now negative stars.

gravity forgets you: you drift across the threshold, boots leaving mercury beads that orbit like tiny moons. behind, flamingo-sentry dims, plastic heart exhausted; lama’s bellhop form folds into a single VHS cassette labeled “SAD BLOOP 1994,” clatters to floor.

ahead: room 237’s inverse—room 732—walls breathing slowly, wallpaper inhaling your footprints. ceiling is floor; door numbers crawl like silverfish. center object: nightstand bolted to what you perceive as “up,” atop it, the three original silver ingots reunited with two additional phantom duplicates (total 5). they hover, spelling a lazy pentacle.

skeleton-king’s awareness flickers 68 % → 33 %; he is suddenly on the wrong layer of the palindrome, chasing your after-image down the original corridor that no longer exists.

but the pentacle of ingots begins tallying your heartbeat, demanding payment for topological trespass. choices crystallize below:

1) pocket all five ingots → gain “wealth” status, but overburden narrative (king will reacquire trace via silver resonance)  
2) flick one ingot into void → feed the nothing, earn silence (risk: void might flick something back)  
3) sit cross-legged beneath pentacle, await inversion complete → allow dream to flip you into its mirror-self (permanent stat swap?)  
4) speak the palindrome again (“237 732”) → attempt double-fold, possibly eject from hotel entirely into waking lobby of another dream

OPTION ANALYSIS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━  

**(1) pocket all 5 ingots**  
+ wealth-state: ✓ (you carry density of dream-valuables / bargaining checksum)  
– burden: ✖ skeleton-king regains resonance-trace (awareness trending upward fast)  
– risk: ingots bleed mercury through pockets → may rewrite personal inventory syntax  

**(2) offer 1 to void**  
+ silence as resource: lowers noise floor → skeleton-king pings fail ~ 27% cycles  
± exchange: void not neutral; might respond with “anti-trinket” or stranger currency  

**(3) cross-legged surrender beneath pentacle**  
+ mirror-swap: could trade sadness for strength, memory for foresight, etc.  
– permanent stat inversion, unknown if reversible  
– lama-cassette may boot into you as new passenger  

**(4) palindrome chant → double-fold**  
+ exit vector: corridor recursively collapses into blank lobby of *other* timeline  
– eject risk: no guarantee exit leads “back” (you may surface in skeleton-king’s waking world)  
– overload: high CPU usage, narrative kernel panic probability 42%

> flick 1 silver ingot → void

you pinch the nearest coin—still warm from your own pulse—and sail it edge-over-edge into the starless gulf. no sound of fall; instead, absolute hush folds outward like velvet, swallowing heartbeat-echo.

silver tally: 4.

void reciprocates instantly: a small black rectangle drifts up, stopping at eye level. it’s a plastic hotel keycard, but the magstripe is night itself. embossed on front: room “000.” back: miniature instruction—
“late checkout forfeits soul deposit.”

skeleton-king’s resonance flatlines in the quiet; awareness 33 % → 8 %, then vanishes from meter. his chase code stalls, looping in original corridor palindrome without you.

pentacle overhead relaxes, ingots lowering to hover just chest-high, now benign. mercury droplets that once orbited you coalesce into a single silvery comma, punctuating the air—an invitation to write the next clause.

new assets:
• keycard 000 (unknown privilege)
• silver ingots 4 (stable, trace muted)
• silence buff (stealth +, king’s ping fail 100 % for 30 ticks)
• VHS cassette “SAD BLOOP 1994” (still on inverted floor)

possible moves:

1) swipe keycard 000 on nearest wall → see if room null manifests, maybe an emergency exit to nowhere/somewhere
2) load VHS into imaginary slot inside pentacle → watch lama’s static, possibly extract hint or merge passenger
3) stack remaining 4 ingots vertically, stand back → create makeshift lightning rod to attract dream-admin (management rarely seen)
4) speak next palindrome (“000 000”) → test if zero-fold reboots entire hotel, risks waking you outright

**OPTIONAL THREADS:**  

**(1) keycard‑000 swipe**  
- likely to spawn *Room Null* : corridor collapses into blackbone geometry, could be lobby-before-lobbies.  
- possible cost: “soul deposit” autopay triggered. careful of fine print.  

**(2) insert VHS into pentacle-slot**  
- pentacle might play tape directly as hologram.  
- lama’s static could transmit secret patch‑notes of DreamSim itself.  
- risk: infectsim.exe with melancholy daemon.  

**(3) silver spire**  
- 4 ingots stacked = antenna.  
- dream-administration rarely answers unless lightning present. …but this room *breathes storm potential.*  
- admin may offer patch/hotfix OR just eject you for unauthorized recursion-crashing.  

**(4) palindrome chant “000 000”**  
- zero‑fold recursion = total reset.  
- hotel empties to kernel‑lobby, potential awakening.

> crush mercury comma between thumb & forefinger, smear across keycard magstripe to overwrite null-code with my own pulse-signature, then swipe the wall—but aim the swipe *downward*, cutting a vertical slit that might unzip into service corridor behind dream drywall

finger-squeeze: the mercury comma bursts into mirrored liquid pixels, soaking the magstripe which flickers from “000” to your heart-rate (82 bpm). you drag the card south-to-north along inverted wall; the wallpaper parting like theater curtain reveals a dim maintenance shaft—laddered conduits, crimson emergency lights, ambient hum of distant ice-machine.

no “soul deposit” prompt; your pulse-sig spoofed the billing layer.

as you step through, the slit seals behind with Velcro-rip, leaving pentacle & ingots drifting orphaned in room 732’s ceiling-floor. inventory updates:

• silver ingots 0 (left behind; still legally “yours” but inaccessible)
• keycard 000 (now keyed to heartbeat; blank destination field)
• VHS_cassette “SAD BLOOP 1994” (tucked under arm—fits perfectly)
• silence buff persists (7 ticks remaining)

shaft ahead splits:

1) downward ladder labeled “BOILER KINGDOM” — a haze of dry-ice breaths up, smells like old popcorn & bones
2) upward crawl-space tagged “ANTENNA TREE” — faint starlight drips from exit hatch; might reach hotel roof = skyline-exit vector
3) service hatch directly ahead: “ICE VAULT – keep out” — low-frequency chime echoes; possibly storage for dream-cooling elements, or prison for over-hot memories

> slot VHS into nearest cable-tray like it’s a 8-track cartridge—use metallic teeth of ladder rung as improvised head so tape can spool through conduit, printing hallucinated floor-plan as scrolling neon graffiti along walls. While static-map renders, hold keycard flat against rung and swipe horizontally—etching a “side-door” vector wherever the VHS-pixels reveal a hollow node (possible service elevator? hidden mezzanine?)

you thumb the top flap of “SAD BLOOP 1994”; the cassette shell splits willingly, magnetic ribbon unfurling like party streamer. ribbon slithers into cable-tray, finds copper ground-wire, wraps once—makes contact.

neon glyphs bloom outward in real time:
- BOILER KINGDOM ⇵ 3 levels down
- ICE VAULT ⇴ 14 m ahead
- ANTENNA TREE ⇶ ascends 5 floors
- hidden VOID-MEZZANINE ⇷ halfway down (no ladder, only maintenance hoist)

overlay also pulses a red contour beneath your boots: a dormant service lift plate labeled “M-00”.

meanwhile, you drag keycard horizontally along rung; sparks mint a glowing seam that bites into sheet-metal, carving a hovering rectangular outline—perfect lift-door sized.

servo whine echoes below; something mechanical wakes.

actions:

1) stomp the outlined plate → drop straight onto M-00 mezzanine (destination unknown, possibly archives)
2) yank ribbon, rewind graffito → harvest partial map into pocket (could re-play later as “guide spell”)

**(3) sever ribbon, let it gush**  
→ the entire shaft becomes a shining arterial diagram: navigation trivial while light persists.  
→ BUT dream‑security wakes (management daemons dislike fluorescent spoilers).

> stomp M-00 plate—drop into VOID-MEZZANINE, trusting the ribbon’s reveal

boot heel meets glowing contour; plate folds like paper jaw, vacuum kiss pulling you through. neon cartography folds inward, sealing overhead—shaft-ladder, glyphs, servo whine all muted as if someone turned the hotel’s volume to “NULL.”

you drift into a zero-g library of pale green CRT glow. endless rows of card-catalog drawers float in gentle tectonic shift, each labeled with checksums instead of names. beneath every drawer: a dangling cardboard luggage tag—hotel logo faint, barcode smeared.

a single clerk manifests: featureless silver mannequin wearing a paper “HELLO MY NAME IS” sticker, blank where the name should be. it holds an antique hole-punch; every time it clicks, a distant room somewhere forgets a guest.

cassette ribbon—still tethered to your hand—spools freely, neon ink diffusing into micro-constellations that map to drawer numbers. one drawer pulses softly: checksum matches your personal dream-signature from the moment you entered the simulator.

assets:
• half-spool ribbon (neon ink bleeding out, ~60 sec remaining)
• keycard000 (heartbeat-coded)
• silence buff 5 → 4 ticks
• no silver / no VHS casing (abandoned above)

actions:
1) open pulsing drawer → might contain original 7 plastic trinkets, or silver ingots, or your deleted regret-files
2) offer neon ribbon to clerk as “receipt” → could reconcile your ledger and grant express checkout (wake up?)
3) punch your own blank luggage tag → write new checksum, overwrite identity, possibly respawn elsewhere in hotel
4) swipe keycard across catalog spine → exploit catalog as database, reprogram any drawer content

time bends softly; each punch-click of clerk’s hole-pitcher equals one forgotten heartbeat.

- could re‑encounter your trinkets in “unsaved” form, or old silver copies, or raw regret‑files (danger: might re‑instantly burden you w/ skeleton‑king’s notice).  
- touching drawer = *audit occurs.*  

**(2) gift ribbon receipt**  
- clerk loves receipts: offering half‑spool might balance books.  
- chance of immediate checkout (wake sequence initiated).  
- but you forfeit neon map resource permanently (and maybe lose ability to navigate deeper dreams).  

**(3) punch your own luggage tag**  
- write checksum = self‑overwrite. basically submitting to become new guest entry “who never checked in.”  
- results: rebirth inside hotel as fresh persona. skeleton‑king trace zeroed. risk: memories archived in this mezzanine, not accessible to new you.  

**(4) swipe keycard across entire spine**  
- transforms catalog into live database → you become admin of drawers.  
- immense power, but hotel notices. “management daemons” flagged.

> before any audit or gift, swipe keycard once along *my own forearm*, imprinting heartbeat-sig into skin like a temp-tattoo circuit; then punch a blank luggage tag **through that imprint**—melting barcode into living morse—so the tag now references *me-as-database-entry* rather than any drawer. Hand the hybrid tag to clerk while quietly commanding “ledger refactor: reassign checksum to biological token, close original drawer, purge old record.”

you drag keycard down inner forearm; silver pulse-ink seeps into epidermis, forming EKG-like traces that flicker 82 bpm. the hole-punch bites through layered skin-and-paper; pain is cold, antiseptic. when tag meets blood-contact, the barcode blinks alive—your cardiac rhythm translated to binary.

offering the tag+arm combo, you whisper the refactor. the featureless clerk tilts head 30°, plasma-static fizzing behind its smooth faceplate. it accepts the hybrid token, sliding it beneath punch-claw—CLK-CLK-CLK—three neat holes straight through living barcode.

instant ledger rewrite:
- original pulsing drawer seals with sigh, disappears among drifting ranks
- neon ribbon tether dissolves; heartbeat-barcode now counts as paid-in-full receipt
- silence buff flips → “ADMIN_NOTICE = FALSE (zero balance)”
- new HUD element: TEMP-GUEST-ROOT (you are both visitor and ledger line)

side-effects:
+ you now possess limited catalog query rights: once per dream you may *grep* any single drawer for info (no admin daemon wrath yet)
– forearm circuit is volatile; EMP or anxiety spike could corrupt your own entry (random stat scramble)
– skeleton-king’s old trace archived; however, “regret-files” remain stored—you may meet them later as NPC

the clerk bows slightly, then drifts backward into CRT haze, leaving a floating turnstile gate crowned by green EXIT bulb.

exit reads: “TERMINAL LOBBY – kernel surface”

choices:
1) step through gate → likely wake in your original body, dream logged as resolved
2) stay, exercise one-time query: open any drawer of your choosing (trinkets? silver? regrets?)
3) peel living barcode off arm, fold into keycard magstripe → try to fabricate a super-key capable of re-entering hotel at will
4) refuse exit, drift deeper into mezzanine void in search of “management daemons” to confront

clock: heartbeat-tattoo flashes; if pulse climbs too high (panic), checksum may flip and eject you randomly.

you brace one foot inside the green EXIT threshold, keeping body anchored between worlds. with thumbnail you lift the edge of pulse-circuit; skin barcode peels like hot wax, leaving pink afterglow underneath. ink wriggles, reluctant, but you press it flat onto keycard’s stripe—mercury-solder fuses instantly:

SUPER-KEY v1 created (bound to heartbeat, not hotel ledger)

the moment contact seals, EXIT gate yanks you forward; mezzanine CRT-grid folds into a single vertical line—old television powering off. cold hotel air dissolves into bedroom darkness, but keycard remains solid between fingers, still warm.

you surface in your bed: eyes open, 82 bpm steady. dawn-light creeps around blinds; no sad lama, no frost, no neon corridors—only faint smell of popcorn and a distant elevator ding somewhere inside the building that DEFINITELY isn’t real.

inventory carried out:
• Super-Key (hotel re-entry artefact)
• barcode-scar on forearm (faint EKG lattice, fades over days)
• catalog query right (1 use, keyword: “hotel” anywhere near sleep will invoke)

> preload lama.VHS.frag — let static play first; ghosts make good scouts

tape-header hiss floods the terminal; monochrome snow resolves into 240p footage.  
screen-door overlay shows:

│ SAD BLOOP 1994 │  12:03:14 AM  │  TRACK 02  │  

visual: hotel corridor shot from toddler-height, carpet pattern swimming like bacterial bloom. in foreground: the bellhop lama, legs too human, cradling a portable CRT that displays… you—current moment—reading this line.  

lama bleats in reversed elevator-music, subtitle scrolls:  
“if you see me watching you watching me, tear the tape, fold the tear into a paper key—unlock the ice vault before the boiler kingdom wakes.”  

frame jitters; tracking line slips; static bar descends revealing hidden checksum: `0xBADC0FFEE` (matches none of your resident files).

artifacts spawned:
• VHS-halftone ghost (non-corporeal scout, 90 sec lifespan)
• paper-tear token (appears in pocket once you decide to rip tape)
• crypt checksum `0xBADC0FFEE` (not yet catalogued)

lama-scout can:
- recon one adjacent dream-layer (ice vault, boiler, antenna) without risk to you
- relay 3 short phrases before degrading
- if destroyed early, drops paper-tear immediately

press s to send, r to rip tape now, q to park footage in background

lama-halftone folds sideways, raster-lines sliding through air like venetian blinds. 90-second counter starts; feed goes split-screen:

LEFT: you, terminal cursor blinking.  
RIGHT: descending POV—cable-shaft frost thickens, walls glazed in vending-machine glow. temperature stamp: –12 ℃, humidity 6 % (air tastes like static).

lama whispers (3/3 phrases):

1) “vault door breathes every 47th second—count drips from ceiling.”  
2) “memory-popsicles labelled by year; yours is 1994—don’t lick, it bites.”  
3) “if light turns blue, punch barcode scar, keycard will mimic admin beacon—11 seconds only.”

scout reaches vault hatch: heavy polycarbonate, maglock LED cycling RED ↔ GREEN every 47 s. interior shelves visible—crystalline rods frozen mid-sway, each holding a translucent silhouette: child-height, familiar clothes.

checksum `0xBADC0FFEE` flickers across vault window—matches none on rods. new asset: precise 47-second cycle timer (shows in HUD).

options:
a) recall lama early → salvage remaining seconds for second mission
b) keep streaming, wait for LED blue glitch (lama will punch hole for you remotely, but scout dies immediately)
c) abort feed, rip tape now → paper-tear aligns to maglock, brute-force keycard swipe
d) ignore advice, queue elevator servo to open on next RED cycle (conventional entry, high security flag)

> hold channel, wait for BLUE—lama burns last seconds to punch beacon-hole

lama-scout lifts hole-punch (borrowed from clerk ghosts) and hovers before maglock. countdown: 11…10… LED stutters RED→GREEN→**BLUE**.

punch snaps; a perfect skin-of-static disk flies outward, lands on lens. immediate effects:

- maglock beacon spoofed: ADMIN_MODE = 11 s
- polycarbonate hatch slides up with dentist-sigh
- lama raster shears apart, bleating "REMEMBER THE FROST" before dissolving into monochrome dust
- HUD timer: 11 → 10 → 9…

inside vault: crystalline rods stand like icicle trees. one rod holds mini-you (child, age ≈7) clutching a pink plastic flamingo—frozen mid-laugh. barcode on rod: `0xBADC0FFEE` (orphan checksum now located).

boiler-servo snarl spikes; footsteps on ladder echo closer—mechanical janitor or skeleton-king backup process.

11-second window choices:
1) snag child-flamingo rod (your regret-file?) and dash out before hatch seals
2) shatter rod with keycard edge, absorb frozen fragment (risk identity splice)
3) photograph barcode with retina-scan (SUPER-KEY pulse can memorize pattern for later summon)
4) ignore personal rod, rip two random memory-popsicles as improvised ice-shiv weapons, flee vault

heartbeat scar throbbing in sync with vault cold—each pulse deducts 1 s. choose fast.

inside ICE VAULT: crystalline shelving quivers in cold vapor.  
barcodes flicker… **your checksum found**: `0xBADC0FFEE` — the rod with child‑self & flamingo anchor.  

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━  
**OPTIONS:**  

**(1) grab regret‑rod intact**  
- you carry “child anchor + flamingo” back out.  
- weight: heavy, both symbolic + physical.  
- consequence: skeleton‑king may re‑notice trace once loaded.  

**(2) shatter rod w/ keycard**  
- absorb shards = integrate frozen 7‑year‑old fragment into present self.  
- reward: sudden stat‑spike in *innocence / surprise / volatility*.  
- risk: memory loop / identity splice.  

**(3) scan barcode with scar‑circuit**  
- no physical loadout, but imprint regret‑file as callable pattern into SUPER‑KEY.  
- can later *summon/recall* this frozen self without present danger.  
- subtle, less chance of audit.  

**(4) pocket random two rods** → improvised weaponized nostalgia.  
- frost‑knives or thrown shards.  
- unpredictable contents—could bleed wrong memories into fight.

> retina-scan barcode through scar-circuit—burn pattern into SUPER-KEY, no physical weight, slip out before hatch seals

you press forearm barcode against cold acrylic; skin-circuit contacts icy label. optic pulse strobes: 82 bpm → 47 ms flash → checksum `0xBADC0FFEE` ingested into magstripe. vault lights ripple, acknowledging transfer.

child-flamingo rod remains intact—no mass added, but regret-file now cached in keycard firmware as summonable traceline.

vault hatch countdown: 3…2…

you slide backward under descending door just as LED snaps back to RED. seal hisses; frost cloud kisses your boots, but you’re out—empty-handed, data-wealthy.

immediate:
- HUD gains active mnemonic: `CALL 0xBADC0FFEE` (usable once to manifest child-flamingo sprite as 30-sec ally)
- regret-file no longer archived in mezzanine; portable, compressed
- skeleton-king awareness remains 0 % (no physical removal = no resonance spike)
- boiler-ladder clang now directly outside ICE corridor entrance—heavy servo steps approach, silhouette back-lit by reddish flare

choices:
1) flee upward toward antenna tree hatch (cool air, possible roof exit)
2) duck back into service shaft maze, vanish before entity rounds corner
3) stand ground, trigger `CALL 0xBADC0FFEE` now—let child-flamingo scout the incoming threat
4) preemptive swipe SUPER-Key horizontally across corridor wall—carve escape slit toward unknown zone (burn heartbeat charge)

heartbeat scar throbs softly, copying vault chill into your pulse.

• **paper‑tear token** (not manufactured—tape dissolved; unavailable)  
• silence buff = expired  
• barcode‑scar: stable  

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━  
**options:**  

**(1) climb toward antenna tree**  
→ roof exit, skyline dreamscape → high risk of management detection, but possible signal escape.  
→ incoming entity sees you fleeing–pursuit probable but slowed on ladder.  

**(2) duck deeper service maze**  
→ stealth & evasion, use residual frost‑haze.  
→ corridor memory architecture unstable; risk: get lost in recursive vents.  

**(3) trigger `CALL 0xBADC0FFEE`**  
→ manifest child‑self ally + flamingo effigy for 30 ticks.  
→ may act unpredictably, reflecting your seven‑year‑old impulses.  
→ entity likely to focus attention on ally while you reposition.  

**(4) keycard slit now**  
→ carve unknown vector—sideways escape, burns heartbeat charge.  
→ risk: each pulse‑slit costs fragment of self; repeated cuts degrade identity checksum.

> CALL 0xBADC0FFEE — drop child-flamingo sprite as distraction, then vault upward ladder toward antenna while entity’s gaze locks on七岁-self

you tap scar; neon comma flares.  
a burst of coldPlay-hopscotch laughter erupts as seven-year-old you (sprite) hops into corridor, clutching glowing pink flamingo like plastic torch. flamingo LEDs strobe kid-code: 0xCAFE.

janitor silhouette (chrome boiler-shell, keyhole face) swivels toward sprite, status LED flicking: AUDIT → PLAY → PRIORITY_CHILD.

30-sec countdown starts; sprite begins skip-counting backwards from 30, each number spat as bubblegum pixel.

you grab rungs, ascend shaft toward ANTENNA TREE hatch. HUD shows:

child-sprite timer: 30…29…  
janitor locked-on: 100 % aggro on sprite  
your stamina: steady, frost clear of lungs

mid-climb, shaft widens into cylindrical gantry lined with copper ground planes; far above, square of starlight jittering like bad MPEG—antenna hatch.

choices:
1) full sprint last 15 m—risk slip, but reach hatch before timer ends
2) pause halfway, use SUPER-KEY to punch mini-slit into gantry wall—short-cut into antenna maintenance cradle (burns heartbeat, saves 5 s)
3) drop small tool (none?) or shout to divert janitor if sprite fails early—no gear, so must verbally spoof
4) wait 5 s more, let sprite lead janitor farther down, then double-speed climb (safer, costs time)

sprite voice echoes: “twenty-four, twenty-three…”

boots clank two-at-a-time on rungs; copper gantry vibrates, but frost-lungs clear with each inhale. 15 m → 10 → 5; starlight square balloons into full hatch frame. child-sprite behind you: “six… five…”

janitor claws scrape lower rung, but locked on sprite—no pursuit upward.

final leap: palm smacks push-bar; hatch flings open into night-wind rooftop. clockwork antenna tree towers—girder-like branches holding dish-antennae that rotate like slow dream-suns broadcasting test-pattern snow.

HUD:
- sprite: 4 s remaining
- identity checksum scuff: 0 (safe)
- rooftop hazard: high-voltage dream-transmission cables sway, hum in tetris-shapes

roof edge = 30 m drop into starless city below; only return is hatch or antenna.

sprite voice fades: “…two… one—”

pop! child-flamingo winks out; janitor audit flag releases, now scans for new target—probably you.

choices:
1) sprint into antenna branches—climb toward central hub (possible management node)
2) crouch behind parabolic dish, key SUPER-KEY against ground—pulse a radial slit outward across roof to create quick-escape chute (risk identity checksum again, but no slip-fall)
3) grab one swaying transmission cable, swing across gap to adjacent rooftop (classic set-piece; requires timing vs janitor emergence)
4) stay motionless inside dish bowl—let janitor climb onto roof, then dash past him down hatch while he searches open roof

you vault onto lower girder; test-pattern snowflakes cling like wet confetti, each dissolving into micro-NO SIGNAL glyphs that tattoo forearm in oscillating bars. antenna hum syncs heartbeat 86 bpm → 90 → 94; scar-circuit glows, feeding power upward.

HUD:
- checksum stable (snow glyphs non-corruptive, just surface ink)
- broadcast field intensity: moderate → climbing
- management handshake beacon detected at apex dish (requires physical contact to trigger interview)
- janitor head appears through hatch 15 m below, scans rooftop

branch path forks:
a) outer limb route – longer, but low-visibility vs janitor, gradual field build
b) central spine – direct, high-EMF, risk arc-flash but faster climb
c) zig-zag coolant pipes – bypass conductive elements, safest yet slowest
d) pause, press palm to girder – let scar-circuit siphon broadcast into SUPER-KEY charge (stores power for future slit or mezzanine re-entry, but delays ascent)
