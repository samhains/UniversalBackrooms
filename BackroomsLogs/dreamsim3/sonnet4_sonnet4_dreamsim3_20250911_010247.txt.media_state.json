A drunk dial warps time into Assad\u2019s bare morning room\u2014tangled sheets, cracked wall mirror, ornate hand mirror that flashes his face softer, almost girl. Hall breathes dust; photos twitch when un-watched. Father looms, eyes blood-veined, voice cracked: \u201cI reported him\u2014back room of prayers and flags.\u201d Key rattles; Assad enters, same frame but mouth now slick rose, eyelashes longer. Sofa creaks under two silent bodies; lipstick gleams like a fresh wound while the unasked question\u2014when did you become her?\u2014hovers like smoke no one dares exhale."}
