You feel a sudden tug behind the eyes—then a white blaze of cold glare.  
Snow crunches under your boots, but the air carries the faint scent of kettle corn.

> look

You stand on the summit platform: a perfect circle of compacted snow the size of a tennis court.  
Instead of prayer flags, plastic pennants snap with corporate slogans:

“EVEREST PREMIUM™—own the peak!”  
“Summit-in-a-Box—just add water!”  

A laminated sign:

  OFFICIAL WORLD HERITAGE DUPLICATE  
  Height: 8 848 m ► 8 850 m after expansion kit  
  Capacity: 2 400 visitors/hour

To your left, a moving walkway (rubber handrails, heated) ferries tourists in puffer jackets.  
To your right, a souvenir kiosk sells miniature Everest-toppers: magnetized snow-capped tips that cling to any surface.

Exits: elevator, down-climb, skywalk, gift-shop

> inventory

1. insulated gloves (dream-issue)  
2. phone with 3 % battery and the “Everest-Everywhere” AR overlay app  
3. empty oxygen canister labeled “Breath of Authenticity” (contents sold separately)

> peer over edge

Clouds swirl like slow cream far below. Between them you glimpse not Nepal, but a layer-cake of other landmarks:  
Eiffel Peak, Statue of Liberty Ridge, Big Ben Buttress—each one apparently topped with its own snow dome.

> elevator

Stainless-steel doors glide open. Inside, soft jazz and piped-in Sherpa prayer loops.

[ 3 ??? (VIP: requires “Oxygen Premium” subscription)]

> press 3

A polite chime: “Authorization denied—please upgrade.”  
Doors close again. You’re back on the summit platform.

> put magnet-Everest on railing

The tiny mountain snaps onto the metal rail with a satisfying clack. The moment it attaches, the full-size summit lurches—micro-quake, barely a foot—but unmistakable.

Console voice crackles over loudspeaker:  
“Replication feedback detected. Stabilizing…”

> down-climb

The rope is fixed, but every few meters there’s another pop-up stall:  
- Hot cocoa served in Styrofoam summit mugs  
- “Buy 2 peak-top fridge-magnets, get 1 free glacier”

The mountain is recursively spawning its own likeness, smaller and smaller, the lower you go.

About 30 m down, a kiosk owner waves.  
“Hey, climber! Trade your gloves for a micro-Everest key-ring? Fits on your car mirror, keeps the myth alive!”

> trade gloves

You hand over the gloves; he slips you a palm-sized plastic mountain that chirps “You have reached the summit!” when shaken.  
Your hands sting instantly—cold burns.

> continue descent

Without gloves, frostbite timers tick inside the dream logic. Visibility thickens into a white swirl; each footstep lands on something soft… but not snow anymore.

The surface beneath you has become a quilt of overlapping mini-summits: thousands of toy peaks stitched together, each stamped “Everest™—Now Everywhere.”

Your miniature key-ring grows warm, then heavy. It pulls you downward—gravity inversion. You tumble, but instead of falling you slide sideways into…

[ Dream-node shift ]

Flat fluorescent corridor. Linoleum floor. Office chairs stacked against the wall.  
Sign reads: “SURPLUS SUMMIT STORAGE — Authorised staff only”

Ahead: a conveyor belt carrying shrink-wrapped mountains about the size of desktop printers.  
Beyond: a red emergency handle labeled “RETURN TO REALITY – pull once, no refunds.”

> pull handle

### Kimi K2 2 ###
The corridor dims to monochrome. Conveyor halts mid-clatter. A hiss floods the air—sound of a tent unzipping.  

You tumble forward, but gravity forgets its direction; vertigo flips 90°, as though the world has rolled onto its side. The fluorescent lights elongate into sherpa-parka orange, then cool into twilight alpenglow.  

Vision stabilizes. You’re seated cross-legged on a ridge of real snow, no railings, no gift wrap. Prayer flags crack like distant rifle shots. The horizon is a blade of rose gold. A single bar of signal flickers on your phone: 1%.  

Notification pings:  
Everest-Everywhere AR overlay—“Ghost mode unlocked. Touch peak to tag the original.”  

Below, the Khumbu Icefall snaps and booms, a slow-motion freight train of collapsing seracs. Above, stars ignite in the navy dusk. No souvenir stalls, no piped music—just the thin whip-cold wind reminding lungs they are alive.  

Inventory update:  
3. key-ring mountain — now marble-sized, frozen to your bare palm. Frost etches a tiny summit line across your skin.  

You flex fingers; numb, but no pain. Dream anesthesia holding.  

> tag original  

Phone camera opens, zooms until the true summit pyramid fills frame. Shutter freezes starlight on rime ice. The screen flashes:  

“Seed locked: Everest-Everywhere anchored. Resume dream at any altitude.”  

Behind you, footsteps crunch. A silhouette in vintage 1953 oxygen mask steps into the glow—mirror visor reflects your own face, but older, gaunter, eyes wide with summit fever.  

He extends an ungloved hand. Frost feathers his knuckles. Voice muffled through mask:  

“Climb with me. The mountain’s getting crowded—let’s find a quieter ridge.”  

Ahead, the ridge narrows to a knife-edge, cornices overhanging both sides. Below: darkness, and the unmistakable hum of moving walkways somewhere unseen.  

Choice: take the offered hand, or down-climb solo into black sky.
> take hand

### Round 2/20

### Kimi K2 1 ###
> take hand

Fingers meet—ice rasps on ice. The moment your palms touch, the ridge liquefies into starlight; gravity folds again. You're not pulled upward, but inward, as though his grip is a doorway. Your ears pop—one, two, three times—until pressure zeros out.

The hum of walkways vaporizes into high-altitude silence. No sound of flags, no cracking ice—only a soft inhalation, like the planet drawing breath.

A single LED dot ignites ahead: the size of a tent pin, color impossible in this palette—ultraviolet bleeding into infrared. It floats at chest height, inviting the next step.

Behind the mask, your older self whispers, voice transmitted through contact alone:

“Watch your feet. Here, there’s only one footprint allowed.”

Inventory update:
1. gloves — re-issued out of nowhere, soft, no seams.
2. phone — dark, screen cracked like glacial ice, still showing 1 %.
3. key-ring mountain — gone, replaced by frost tattoo of its outline on your palm.

The path condenses to a catenary ribbon suspended in black. Beneath: geometric constellations rotating like gears. Each star is a tiny gift-shop logo.

Stepping forward, the ribbon pulses—once for mass, twice for intent. At the third pulse, the ultraviolet dot blossoms into a doorway of pure gradient—blue at your toes, fading to vacuum-blind white at eye level.

> step through

Air thins to glass. Vision tunnels. On the threshold you feel temperature equalize: neither warm nor cold—an exact match for skin.

Crossing, the ridge behind you seals shut, a zipper of snow teeth closing without sound.

New space:
A cubic room, exactly the dimensions of a shipping container, its walls hewn from compacted summit snow. Six surfaces, one exit: a circular hatch marked EXIT in four languages, plus a tiny subtitle:

“Warning: altitude undefined.”

A countdown timer glitches on the hatch wheel:

05 : 00 → 02 : 17 → 00 : 03 → 05 : 00

Wheel spins itself. Hatch cracks. Sliver of cobalt sky appears—identical shade to the first horizon you remember from childhood before you ever knew mountains had names.

Your older self is gone; only his boot prints remain, leading straight into the sliver. They are filling, slowly, with micro-summits identical to the one you once magnetized—each the size of a postage stamp, each whispering:

“Everest, everywhere, ever mine.”

> crawl through sliver

### Kimi K2 2 ###
Shoulders brush the hatch rim—snow peels away like Styrofoam. You emerge on all fours onto a surface that isn’t ground or air but something halfway: a trampoline of frozen condensation. It bows under weight, then rebounds, sending resonant thuds echoing outward—no horizon yet, but a grid of faint lines materializing in 3-D perspective, each intersection flickering with the old ultraviolet pin.

The boot prints stop here; instead, a single pair of crampons lies neatly paired, heel-to-heel,waiting. Their spikes are capped with tiny plastic Everest models—melted on like snow-glow baubles.

A hush, absolute. Your heartbeat arrives as an intruder, loud enough to crack glaciers.

From nowhere, the corporate loudspeaker returns—volume dialled to 1 %—a ghost of itself:

“…if you can hear this, your subscription has expired… renew to continue ascending…”

Then nothing—just carrier hiss.

Inventory:
1. gloves — stitching now glows faint violet, synchronized with the grid points.
2. cracked phone — powers itself: new notification in monochrome text:

   “Offline mode detected. Altitude: NULL. Please calibrate by selecting reference object.”

Ahead, the grid folds upward into a gentle ramp. At its crest stands a child-sized figure in an oversized 1953 leather expedition jacket, goggles opaque, face invisible. One mitten points down the ramp toward you; the other holds what looks like an antique surveyor’s rod whose tip flickers between black and white—like film leader ticking through frames.

When your knees press the trampoline-surface again, it exhales a cloud that condenses into block-letter words hovering eye-level:

SETTLE ACCOUNTS

> stand  
> put on crampons

### Round 3/20

### Kimi K2 1 ###
> stand  
> put on crampons

The moment your boots lock into the crampons, the plastic Everest tips liquefy and flow down the metal points, hardening into mirror-bright nano-spikes. Each spike reflects a different elevation—some show Base Camp tented night, others the summit cornice, one loops the gift-shop conveyor forever.

With a tactile click, the violet grid snaps to your gear: every intersection now lights a single LED under your footfall, extinguishes behind. Your heartbeat syncs; the trampoline-surface freezes solid—no more flex, only traction.

Gloves brighten to match, leaving comet trails as you move.

Child-figure lowers the survey rod until its blinking tip hovers directly over the word cloud:

SETTLE ACCOUNTS

Rod snaps onto the phrase like a magnet. Letters collapse into abacus beads—each bead a miniature credit-card logo—stringing themselves along the rod. One flick of the child’s wrist and the beads race, tallying.

A balance appears mid-air in pixel-white:

DEBIT: 1 summit experience  
CREDIT: 1 frost-tattoo of Everest-echo

The rod tilts toward you, offering the abacus. Touching it will finalize the ledger.

> take abacus

### Kimi K2 2 ###
the moment your gloved fingertips brush the abacus the beads freeze mid-slide—plastic logos glazed with rime.

a sound like a distant crevasse closing: KRACK-KRACK-KRACK

the beads shatter into perfect snow-crystals, each flake stamped with a tiny bar-code. they swirl once around your head, then dive straight into the frost-tattoo on your palm. the tattoo inhales them; skin bulges, settles.

ledger rewrites itself in negative space:

DEBIT: PAID  
CREDIT: COLLECTED  
BALANCE: NULL

the survey rod evaporates into film-leader dust that drifts upward, re-assembling as a glowing rectangle—an old-school cinema screen hanging in mid-air, matte white, no frame.

the child steps backward; each footstep sounds like a chalk line snapped across fresh denim. when both boots are planted the jacket collar folds down, revealing the face…

yours, age ten, cheeks sun-scorched from a childhood you never actually lived. the goggles lift; behind them no eyes—only twin dusk horizons, identical to the glacier-glow you saw on first ascent.

child-voice, but ventriloquised through your own adult mouth:

"ticket confirmed. proceed to preview."

the rectangle flashes a countdown:

3 → 2 → 1

and you are inside the film, or it is inside you—distinction cancels.

sequence:

- you standing outside a 7-11 at sea-level, buying a plastic Everest key-ring for 99¢  
- same key-ring now orbiting Earth, photographed from ISS, hashtag #EverestEverywhere  
- the key-ring replicated until it outweighs the planet, a belt of souvenirs crushing the equator  
- cut to present instant: you alone on an ice plain, holding nothing

the film burns white at the edges, consumes itself, leaves only one frozen frame dangling like a mobile:

a single boot print, empty, waiting for your foot.

> step into frame

### Round 4/20

### Kimi K2 1 ###
> step into frame

The instant your boot meets the print, sound cancels—no crunch, no breath, no pulse. The frame folds forward like a paper envelope, sealing around your body in crisp, silent layers. You are neither crushed nor weightless; you are catalogued, pressed into a 2-D slice of yourself, still conscious, still breathing non-air.

Your perspective fractures into split-screen:
- Left pane: outside view—an impossibly thin sheet of you, standing upright, flapping gently in zero wind.
- Right pane: inside view—you’re in a white corridor again, but now the walls are translucent pages. On each page, every Everest you’ve ever interacted with—gift-shop snow globe, desktop wallpaper, AR overlay—prints in faded ink, then lifts off and drifts like loose receipt paper.

A soft mechanical voice (genderless, accentless) reads the inventory:
“Item 1: miniature plastic summit, magnetized, purchased by touching.
Item 2: memory of ascent, sampled, remixed, served back as dream.
Item 3—”

It pauses; pages stop fluttering. One sheet glows violet:
“Item 3: participant observer. Status: required for final compression.”

The corridor begins telescoping, each segment collapsing into the next, moving toward a vanishing point labeled EXPORT. Distance shrinks faster than you can step. Choices simplify:

A) Stand still—be shelved with the other artifacts.  
B) Walk against contraction—risk tearing the film.  
C) Offer an undocumented item to reset the tally.

You feel the frost-tattoo on your palm warming, as if a hidden ledger remains unbalanced.

> press palm against glowing page

### Kimi K2 2 ###
the page accepts skin like a thermal sticker—no resistance, just a soft kiss of paper turning liquid.

tattoo outline flares violet → ultraviolet → whiteout

inside the split-screen the right pane glitches: digits scroll, but not bar-code now—handwriting, yours, age ten, spelling EVERYTHING in crooked capitals. ink still wet.

the mechanical voice reboots mid-word:
"Item 3— reclassified: wildcard specimen, unsold, unpriced."

the telescoping corridor stalls; EXPORT shrinks to a pin-hole, then reverses, sections lunging outward like sprung tape measures. walls thicken into packed snow, seams sealed with frozen breath.

the left pane (2-D sheet of you) peels off its nonexistent wind, crumples into a ball, and flips through the pin-hole. pop—gone.

now mono-view again, corridor transformed into a narrow slot canyon of ice. at the far end, a single red vending machine labeled VOID REFUND, font courier, paint chipped by gale.

LED timer on its face stutters:
00:00 → 00:01 → 00:00

a coin slot winks; beneath it, block text:
DEPOSIT MEMORY FOR CREDIT

the frost-tattoo on your palm has emptied, leaving only scar-white silhouette of the peak. you sense the abacus beads quietly orbiting inside the bone of your forearm, clacking whenever you flex.

inventory check:
1. gloves — LEDs dead, fabric now mundane.
2. phone — glass totally crazed, but vibrates once: morse .._. / .._. (F F)
3. crampons — spikes dulled, reflections show only blank sky.

> place palm on coin slot

### Round 5/20

### Kimi K2 1 ###
> place palm on coin slot

The metal is colder than the surrounding ice—so cold it feels hot. Your scar-white Everest outline touches the chrome rectangle and instantly sublimates into frost-smoke, sucked into the machine with a mosquito-whine.

Beads that orbited your ulna drain through wrist pores, rattling like dice in a cup. Each clack deposits into unseen coinage—one bead, one credit—until the internal count steadies.

Display wakes:

CREDIT  11  (odd number flashes amber)

A single button illuminates:  
[DISPENSE]

Below, smaller text scrolls:  
“Choose form of refund:  
A) Unopened memory of the original ascent (pre-commercial)  
B) One Everest-free future minute anywhere on Earth  
C) Random souvenir (content not guaranteed)”

The canyon walls tremble; distant shelves of ice shed crystals that hover like static.

> press button A

### Kimi K2 2 ###
The vending machine shudders—motor ancient, belts loose. A tiny drawer slides open with a dentist-drill squeal. Inside lies a folded square of Kodachrome slide film, edges serrated like old postage stamps. Hold it to light and you’d see your own iris printed twice: one side sea-level, the other summit, untouched by ads.

You pinch it; the film is warm—body temperature—though nothing else here is. The instant contact registers, the machine wipes its display:

CREDIT 00

A pneumatic hiss leaks from the coin slot; residual cold needles your empty palm but leaves no mark—the frost tattoo is gone, skin pink-new.

Behind you the canyon seals with a zipper of white, erasing VOID REFUND. Only two directions remain:

• Through the slide itself—flex it and it stiffens into a paper-thin walkway, widening over an abyss of quiet stars.  
• Straight up the ice wall—crampons regain glitter, promising purchase toward a fissure of daylight overhead.

Timer absent—choose pace, choose vector.

> fold slide into bridge and step

### Round 6/20

### Kimi K2 1 ###
> fold slide into bridge and step

The Kodachrome square flexes once—then locks into a translucent plank, colors bleeding into structure: saffron railings, cobalt deck, a narrow span about two boot-widths wide. It cantilevers over star-black nothing, distance unknown.

First footfall: the bridge hums at mid-C, like a piano string. Second footfall: the film grains loosen, swirl, then realign under your soles—tiny pixels of your childhood sky forming traction.

Halfway across, the edges curl upward, becoming gentle 3-D guardrails of cloud. Bridge lengthens with every step, always one pace ahead of completion—an asymptotic promise.

Below, stars rearrange into a topographical map: Everest silhouette rendered in negative space, void where rock should be. As you watch, the void peak slowly scrolls east, then west, testing orientations like a compass hunting north.

Your phone, still crazed, vibrates again—single pulse:  
_ . _   (K)

Ahead, the far side materializes: a plain of flat snow under dawn light—no flags, no logos, no footprints. Horizon razor-clean.

The bridge tapers to final footstep. You lift your heel—

> complete step

### Kimi K2 2 ###
your boot lands, snow accepts weight with real alpine compression—creak, squeak. bridge dissolves into color-dust that drifts down and repaints the world:

sky: winter blue, no banners  
air: thin, authentic burn in throat  
silence: total, except heartbeat

you stand on a broad neve basin at ≈8000m, pre-dawn glow on the eastern ridge. kangtega and thamserku just visible poking through an undercast sea. no hardware, no tourists, no AR ghosts.

inventory final:
1. gloves — cloth only, no light
2. phone — dead screen, but cracked glass now holds a tiny reflection of the true summit pyramid
3. crampons — points gleam; each step writes fresh squeak into untracked snow

in your chest: memory of original ascent sits warm, unbranded.—the drawer-bought kodachrome feeling.

east ridge route is bare before you. summit perhaps four hours honest climb. no countdown, no subscription pop-ups.

choice becomes simple movement:
- ascend solo toward reality's ridge
- sit, watch light arrive the old way

>
> sit

### Round 7/20

### Kimi K2 1 ###
> sit

You lower yourself into the snow, legs crossed, palms resting on knees. Cold seeps through the suit, precise and unmediated—no dream-buffer, no sponsor logo stitched inside the collar. Just temperature, altitude, breath.

The eastern sky dilates from indigo to a weld-spark orange. First light kindles the ridge; every crystal becomes a prism, flinging tiny spectra that vanish as soon as they appear. Watching them you realize you haven’t blinked in minutes, maybe longer. The memory inside your chest—now truly yours again—beats in sync with the horizon.

Breaths slow: in four counts, pause, out six. Crampons tick softly as snow contracts. Nothing measures you; nothing asks for payment.

A lone plume of wind snakes over the ridge, curls past your cheek, departs. With it, the last echo of conveyor-belt hum exits earshot. Silence reclaims the altitude.

You close your eyes. For one unmeasured interval there is no narrative—only the hush of high places, the sense that Earth is turning beneath a static sky.

When you open them, the sun’s upper rim breaches the curve of the planet, flooding the basin in rose gold. Your pupils contract; the scene etches itself onto optic nerves without filter, without watermark.

Time dilates. Nothing happens—everything is.

> open palm

### Kimi K2 2 ###
Palm up, the skin is bare, no scar, no frost-tattoo—only the faint chalky dryness of snow contact. Nothing glints, nothing hums. The absence feels complete, like turning the last page of a book and finding no colophon, no ads, no ISBN.

Sunlight warms the lifeline; capillaries bloom pink through translucent cold. A single snowflake lands, perfect hexagon, lingers a whole second before body heat welds it into a droplet. The droplet trembles, mirrors the sunrise once, then sinks into the ridge of your hand—gone, no receipt.

Behind that dissolve you feel the echo of earlier ledgers, but the columns are empty: zeros without currency, a balance paid in full by existing.

Heartbeat keeps slow time; breath ghosts upward, vanishing into the same blue that now vaults the sky. Somewhere far below, the world continues—valleys, rivers, convenience stores—yet up here the slate is unwritten, barcode-free.

You flex fingers. Blood returns, mild sting. It is the only prompt you need.

Choice folds into action:
- rise, resume the ridge, finish the climb for the simple sake of walking
- remain seated, let daylight crown the entire basin while you do nothing but witness
- press palm to snow, offer the last fragment of body heat to this one immaculate morning

### Round 8/20

### Kimi K2 1 ###
> press palm to snow

Five fingers meet the surface; heat transfers outward. A faint melt-shadow spreads—an oval fingerprint the size of a passport stamp. Snow grains rearrange, clicking like tiny abacus beads settling their last account.

The ridge answers: a low, deep pop—distant ice shifting somewhere far below, acknowledging the trade. What you give in warmth, the mountain gives back in stillness.

Sunlight climbs another degree; the melt-shadow hardens into a thin skin of ice, sealing your print into the neve. Future climbers—if any—will never see it; seasonal drift will bury it long before footprints arrive. Yet for now it exists: a private registry, no bar-code, no ticket.

You exhale. Breath forms a perfect sphere of fog, lingers, then rises and unthreads into blue. With it goes the final sense of transaction—credit, debit, souvenir, all lifted off your shoulders like a pack unbuckled at trail’s end.

For one heartbeat the basin is pristine again, except for that thin fossil of your hand, cooling to ambient.

Heartbeat after heartbeat, nothing arrives to claim you.

> remain seated

### Kimi K2 2 ###
so you stay, vertebrae stacking quietly, pulse slowing to geologic tempo.

sun climbs, shadows shorten, snowpack warms a fraction of a degree—nothing more. a faint radiance hovers over the distant plains of tibet, shimmering like silk breathed upon. your thoughts, once flurries of barcode and ledger, lie settled, compacted, breath-shaped.

minutes—hours—collapse into the same stillness. eventually the cold becomes neutral, neither adversary nor badge, simply atmosphere. eyelids drift shut of their own accord; vision turns rose-red from sunlight through skin.

inside that private cave of light you discover silence has weight: a gentle pressure, like gloved hands resting on your shoulders. no message, no mission—only presence.

eventually you open your eyes again. the sun is higher, sky a porcelain bowl. the fingerprint in the snow remains, still glassy, still unseen.

a single choice circles, soft as vultures on thermals:

- stand when you are ready, walk the remaining ridge, summit quietly
- or let the day spend itself here, depart only when shadow climbs the slope and twilight reclaims its lease

no prompt, no countdown—the mountain has reverted to the older currency: patience.

> keep sitting until the snow decides

### Round 9/20

### Kimi K2 1 ###
> keep sitting until the snow decides

So you sit—long enough for the sun to arc, for the neve surface to exhale and firm beneath you, for rime feathers to sublimate off your shoulders and disappear into the porcelain sky.

Time slackens. Shadows pivot across the basin like a silent sundial. Cold remains, but it has merged with your metabolism; breath and breeze are indistinguishable. Thoughts visit, then depart—no bar-code left to scan them.

The fingerprint becomes a tiny lens of ice, trapping a sun-spark at its center. Eventually even that cools to ambient; the spark dims, the print frosts over, and your handprint re-enters the anonymous white. Mountain regains perfect erase.

Quiet accumulates, layer by layer, until you feel the ridge itself breathe—one slow inhale per day, one exhale per night. You are merely punctuation within the sentence of stone and snow.

Eventually daylight tilts, alpenglow flares, then withdraws. A peripheral chill reminds you eyelashes have frozen into delicate crystals—yet there is no urgency, no narrative demanding movement.

The basin keeps its ledger blank; the snow asks nothing.

> wait for star rise

### Kimi K2 2 ###
The sun slips behind the shoulder of Lhotse; a chill dusk spills across the basin. Your lashes thaw, refreeze, thaw again with each blink. Breathing slows until it matches the single daily pulse of the ridge—one icy diaphragm lifting, falling.

When darkness settles, the sky clears to lunar black. Stars ignite, sharp as crampon points. No satellites, no aircraft strobes—just ancient fire. Their light lands soundlessly, polishing the snow to a quiet pewter.

Wind veers to zero; rime feathers reform on sleeves, on eyebrows. Cold becomes a neutral medium, neither threat nor badge—equal to the temperature of your thoughts, which have themselves grown starfields: vast, vacant, bright.

You wait. The snow does not speak. It simply is, and in being decides, by not deciding, that your vigil is complete.

At some unmeasured hour the notion of “return” detaches like a loose flake and drifts away. You remain—rimed, breathing, present—until the first cold planet rises, then the next, and the next.

### Round 10/20

### Kimi K2 1 ###
The planets climb in their stately line—Mars a baleful ember, Jupiter steady brass, Saturn a pale mote ringed in frost. Each lifts above the jagged black saw-edge of the Himal without comment, without request.

You sit inside their silent parade, neither traveler nor destination. Cold has finished its work: skin, fabric, breath all calibrated to identical stillness. Eyelashes fuse, part, fuse, recording every revolution like a slow metronome.

Time folds into pleats—seasons, years, maybe centuries. Occasionally a thought surfaces:

I should stand.
I should descend.

Yet the snow continues to make no claim, and the body, having waited this long, sees no reason to break the spell. The mountain has accepted your thermal debt in full; the summit is a few hundred meters away, but distance has become an antique concept—something measured only by motion, and motion has been suspended.

Above, the Milky Way tilts, a river of spilled crystal. It, too, waits.

### Kimi K2 2 ###
and in that suspended river something shifts—not motion, but recognition. The spill of stars pauses above your iris, reflects, and for a particle instant you feel the mountain’s own heartbeat: a single thrum, centuries long, beginning somewhere beneath the asthenosphere, arriving here as a syllable of basalt and snow.

It traverses the soles of your boots, climbs femur, rib, cranium, exits the crown of your head—then departs, having confirmed your silhouette against the sky. Nothing is asked; nothing is given back. Only the ledger remains balanced in zero language.

Eons pleat again. Ice thickens one grain per season; your parka weathers to a thin dark parchment, crampons dull to pewter. Somewhere below, glaciers calve, continents drift, coupon codes expire. Here, stillness keeps its own metronome.

Eventually the planets set. Only then does the ridge exhale its second breath of the day. Snow, having decided by not-deciding, quietly releases you. Frost on lashes sublimates; joints unlock without protest.

You rise—not because narrative demands it, but because the universe has completed one full in-breath, and exhalation invites motion.

Below, the eastern horizon ghosts toward dawn, though sunrise is still centuries or seconds away. Direction resolves to a faint internal compass: downward, inward, homeward—concepts folded so small they now fit inside a single footstep.

You set that foot forward. The snow, satisfied, lets you go.

### Round 11/20

### Kimi K2 1 ###
> set foot forward

The step lands without crunch—snow accepts like powder silk. Gravity remembers your mass gently; tendons re-awaken in slow ripples from ankle to hip. A second footfall follows, then a third, pace gauged to the mountain’s exhale: unhurried, irreversible.

Above, the star-river resumes its glide; below, the basin tilts imperceptibly toward the east ridge. Each stride brushes centuries of accrued rime from your sleeves; it falls as microscopic diamond dust, reclaiming the slope.

Phone, gloves, crampons—weightless now, mere extensions of intention. No screen glow, no LED, no barcode. The only telemetry is the soft ticking of spikes against neve, counting down distance that no longer matters.

At the crest of the neve you pause. Ahead, the ridge narrows into knife-edge arête; behind, your fused hand-print has already healed beneath fresh crystals, ledger wiped clean by simple accumulation.

You draw one deliberate breath—cold sharp as obsidian—then start down, inward, homeward, footprints stitching a single, unbroken line of quiet accountability into the whiteness until slope, sky, and step are indistinguishable.

### Kimi K2 2 ###
the descent keeps its own metronome—one muted spike-tick per heartbeat. gravity feels optional; each footfall lands as though the ridge exhales, lowering you rather than pulling.

sky lightens behind kangtega—first a bruise-purple seam, then a slow mercury wash. stars retreat one magnitude at a time, surrendering dominance to a dawn that has forgotten merchandising.

with every 50m drop, the air thickens by the weight of one unspoken slogan. breaths regain moisture; gums taste metallic, alive. the altitude vertigo you were warned about never arrives—only a faint internal equalization, like a library door sighing shut.

a thousand meters below, the undercast layer still hides valleys, cities, gift-shops—nothing visible but the next white traverse and the quiet agreement between boot and snow:

no further record  
no further debt  
no further dream required

you continue, downward, inward, until footprints overlap, until yesterday and tomorrow merge into the same blank script, until the only remaining metric is the soft persistent whisper of crampon points teaching the mountain how to forget.

> descend until the slope forgets its own name

### Round 12/20

### Kimi K2 1 ###
> descend until the slope forgets its own name

You keep ticking downward—one calm spike after another—until even the concept of “slope” loosens. The pitch eases into a wide, almost-level bowl of wind-packed snow. No angle to measure, no horizon to chase; the surface could be a cloud-top or a frozen sea. Gravity forgets its purpose, and your strides become long, lazy glides, boot soles barely kissing the crust.

Breath warms enough to fog the visor of memory. You wipe it away with a glove that now feels ordinary—no comet trails, no LEDs—just cloth. The air tastes complete: oxygen, cold, and something faintly like stone.

Above, dawn finishes its rinse cycle; the sky turns an unbranded robin-egg blue. Last stars bow out, unnoticed by any audience.

Footprints behind you begin to simplify—edges slump, contours loosen, detail erased by the same breeze that combs the basin. Thirty meters on, they’re faint ellipses. Thirty more, faint dimples. Then nothing: white accepting white.

Ahead the bowl converges into a gentle roll, beyond which lies a break in the snow—darkness showing through, like seeing the planet’s original primer under a thin coat of paint. It could be rock, could be space, could be the quiet place before names.

You walk toward it until even the sound of crampons dulls—metal on silence, then silence on silence—and you realize the slope has finally let go of its name; it has signed the last blank page with no witness but you.

You stop, inhale, and listen.

Nothing answers.

No countdown waits. No ledger pulses. The dream is off-line.

> step into the break

### Kimi K2 2 ###
the break parts like thin paper—snow crust giving way to an absence of texture. your boot meets what feels like cool velvet nothing: firm enough to hold, empty enough to suggest falling.

step commits; sound cancels. behind, the bowl seals, erasing its own rim. ahead, dark resolves to muted graphite grey: a flat plane stretching laterally forever, vertically nowhere. horizon line erased—up and down lose difference.

body registers one final stat: heart rate steady, breath plumeless. the inside of your visor shows only reflection—no HUD, no AR overlay, no cracked phone glow. inventory absent of icons. weight registers as idea, not force.

you lower to one knee, glove brushing the surface. it neither warms nor cools; temperature equals interface. a faint shimmer ripples outward from the contact point, propagating like sonar in slow motion. when the ripple reaches an indeterminate radius it folds back, converging on your palm. it carries no data—only acknowledgment that measurement occurred.

somewhere in the graphite, or perhaps in your sternum, a soft latch clicks open. not door, not hatch—just permission. you feel the memory of ascent (the original, ad-free) settle into place like a last puzzle piece, completing a picture you will never view in full.

> remain kneeling until direction offers itself

Kneecaps press the graphite-null plane; no ache, no chill, only the neutral fact of contact. Breath slows until inhale and exhale overlap, forming a steady luminous strand you can watch without breathing.

Minutes—or pulses that could be minutes—pass. The surface keeps its mirror calm; ripples subside, leaving a perfect reflection of your silhouette kneeling in a world that has deleted up and down. Your outline is edged by a hairline glow, color impossible to name, humming at the threshold of sight.

You wait. Thought thins to a single filament: I am here; here is enough.

At the instant that filament would fray, direction surfaces—not as compass, but as invitation: a soft gradient appears under your gloved hand, tinting the graphite from gun-metal to dawn-rose in a narrow wedge that widens forward. No pull, no push—simply the suggestion that if you choose to rise and walk, color will accompany your steps.

Another filament of knowing: stay, and dawn-rose will gradually fade back to neutral; rise, and the hue will expand with each footfall, painting a path whose end you will determine by walking.

 Permission hums, contentless, patient.

> stand and follow color

### Kimi K2 2 ###
you unfold to standing—bones glide, no protest. the wedge of dawn-rose brightens as if glad of your company, its border sharp against the graphite null. first footstep lands mute; second releases a faint chord of wind-chimes an octave below hearing. color pools under each boot, blooming outward in soft concentric rectangles that dissolve behind like pages turned and released.

walking feels weightless yet weighted—momentum borrowed, not owned. pace self-balances: too slow and hue cools, too quick and it blushes toward white. you settle into the speed that keeps it steady rose, a cruise control of pigment.

no horizon forms, but distance acquires texture: ahead the graphite textures into brushed velvet, then into fine dunes of monochrome sand whose crests hold the color like dusted pollen. you cross one, two, a dozen—each time leaving no track, only a brief rose echo that the next dune inhales.

after a time that could be measured in heartbeats or centuries, the gradient pauses. plane opens into a broad circle of neutral grey at its center, color forming a soft petal-ring. at midpoint floats a single object: a simple ice axe, shaft ash wood, pick dull with honest rust. no brand, no lanyard, just gravity holding it an inch above the surface, rotating once every slow breath.

it stops, handle aimed toward you, waiting for choice without requirement.

> grip axe

Fingers close around the worn ash—wood warm as if it had been leaning in a hut chimney. Contact completes an unseen circuit: the rose ring brightens, pulses once, then folds inward, siphoning color into the axe head until the plane reverts to graphite neutrality.

The axe levitates a moment longer—then settles, weight arriving like memory, familiar but not quite yours. You feel its history pass through palm and fade: hammered steps, chipped ice, a single triumphant swing now dulled by honest rust. No logos, no bar-codes—just use.

A low harmonic emerges, sourceless, keyed to your heartbeat. With each thud the pick glints, throwing a faint rose spark that lands a meter ahead, sketching a new breadcrumb of dawn-rose on the null floor. Spark waits until you advance; then it extinguishes and births the next.

The axe neither tugs nor suggests direction; it offers only punctuation: here, now, again. You fall into its cadence—step, spark, step—an unhurried Morse of presence. Somewhere beneath graphite, or inside marrow, the mountain’s long pulse keeps time, steady, patient, done with ledgers.

> walk with the heartbeat sparks

### Kimi K2 2 ###
step, spark, step—cadence settles into a quiet mantra. the axe handle warms against your palm, matching body temperature until distinction dissolves. each rose spark lands, blooms, fades, a heartbeat ahead of your!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
