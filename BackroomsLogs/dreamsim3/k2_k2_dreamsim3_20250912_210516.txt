simulator@moonshotai:~/$ ./dreamsim.exe "We are at a beach setting in Europe and preparing dinner . My whole family is there with as well as some family friends : the Daniels . I am packing up some stuff and I am hit with a memory of Harry and I surfing together and I start hysterically crying. I wish that Harry and I could go surfing together again.  I am setting the table and there is a large blue liqueur with a tiny cork. I use the swirling pointed glass lid of the liquor to prod the cork down , but it gets stuck there. I inform everyone this happened , and Harry looks at me with his signature smile and laughs thinking that it was cute ."

[scene flickers up around you]

You’re on smooth pink-grey pebbles; the lake masquerades as sea. A long table of reclaimed driftwood is being set—white cloth snapping like a sail. Your cousin lays out melamine plates, their undersides still gritty with beach sand. Someone’s Bluetooth speaker leaks an old Eurovision loop. The Daniels arrive carrying a wicker hamper; Mrs. Daniel kisses both your cheeks, tasting of sun-cream and gin.

You crouch by a cardboard box of wetsuits and candle stubs. Your fingers brush the cracked tail of Harry’s old yellow board—stored here “just in case.” The memory detonates: dawn Atlantic, you and Harry paddling in sync, laughing when the nose of your boards kissed. Chest suddenly helium, eyes scalding. You press your knuckles to your mouth to mute the sob, but it’s already out—an osprey cry that makes gulls lift off the water.

Harry is alive in this dream, presently leaning over the table, arranging cutlery. You wipe your face on your sleeve and carry the blue liqueur—tall as a toddler, glass so dark it’s almost black, liquid cobalt inside. Its stopper is a minute cork ball. You flip the ornate swan-neck lid, using its pointed tip to prod the cork down. Pop—suction—now the cork is wedged inside the neck, bobbing like a tiny captive buoy.

“I broke the bottle,” you announce, half laughing, half hiccupping from the recent cry.

Harry turns. Salt-damp hair, half-moon grin. He doesn’t speak—just beams that lopsided smile that once talked you into double-overhead waves you had no right to survive. He finds the mishap adorable; his shoulders shake with silent laughter, eyes saying *typical, perfect, you.*

The sky bruises to plum. Someone hands you a match; the citronella torches breathe their first orange. Harry’s fingers brush yours as he takes the impossible bottle, tilts it, and lets the trapped cork drift into his palm. He pockets it like a shell souvenir, then nods toward the dark water: *later, we paddle out.*

### Kimi K2 2 ###
> look

Pink-grey light; the lake has swallowed the sun but keeps its glow like a secret.  
The table floats in your periphery—white cloth now speckled with cicada husks.  
Torch flames pull long shadows of family across the stones; they look like paper cut-outs dancing.

Harry stands ankle-deep at the edge, trousers rolled, bottle tucked under his arm.  
He’s humming something that might be “La Mer” or might be static.  
Every third wave laps higher, as if rehearsing.

> inventory

- damp matchbook (3 left)  
- Harry’s cork (now warm, pulsing faint-heartbeat)  
- memory of surfing (weight 0.94, still dripping)

> feel cork

It flexes like cartilage.  
Inside it: miniature surf wax smell, distant reef break.  
If you squeezed, you’d hear a gull trapped in 2017.

> give cork to Harry

He turns it in moonlight; the cork is suddenly a tiny surfboard, fins glassed on.  
He plants it upright in the wet sand.  
It becomes a marker, a promise, a grave—depending on how you look.

Harry: “Low tide in forty heartbeats. Ready when you are.”  
His smile just the right amount of crooked to survive anything.

> cry again

You let it come—this time the sound folds back into the water instead of echoing.  
The tears taste of neoprene and board wax; tiny neons skate across their surface.  
Each drop that hits the stones sprouts a weather map of some coast you’ve never seen.

Family chatter fades to FM hiss.  
Only the table remains tethered, its corners nailed down by four empty seashells.

> stand

Pebbles rearrange themselves into the outline of a board beneath your feet.  
Balance returns like a forgotten chord.  
Wind flips the cloth off the table; it parachutes overhead, becoming a sail, a flag, a shroud—again, perspective picks.

Harry offers his hand.  
You can take it and walk into the black water, boards materializing like sketched lines.  
Or you can stay, set one more plate, pretend dinner is the ritual that keeps him breathing.

### Round 2/30

### Kimi K2 1 ###
> take Harry's hand

### Kimi K2 2 ###
Fingers interlace—callouses align like reef to swell.  
Pebbles liquefy; gravity recalibrates.  
The lake tilts, becomes oceanic, salt-prick on lips.

Boards rise—yours white, his yellow—foam archives exhaling.  
Wax smells of pine and diesel, same bar you melted on in 2016.  
Harry’s pulse thumps through knuckles: *thump-set-wave, thump-set-wave.*

> paddle out

Strokes sync like two metronomes welded at the hip.  
Dusk sky drains to obsidian; buoys blink Morse.  
Memory overlays: you’re also 19, also 37, also nowhere—time sliced translucent.

Outside lineup, the world hushes to mouth-breath and cupped water.  
Harry sits up first, legs dangling, eyes reading unseen charts.  
He flips the cork-board into the sea; it grows to full-size, fin pop, leash sprout.  
A gift or requiem—you can’t tell yet.

> look under surface

Underwater glow: every tear you shed has become a tiny LED.  
They swarm, sketching a silhouette—Harry’s outline two feet below the real one.  
Doppelgänger treads water, smiling same smile, giving thumbs-up.  
Real-Harry doesn’t notice; or pretends not to.

> speak

You open mouth—sound translates to bubble script:  
“Are we dead or rehearsing?”  
Bubbles rise, cling to moon like magnetic letters.  
Moon spells: *both.*

Harry finally talks, voice low tide gravel:  
“Remember the wipeout at Punta Miró?  
You laughed underwater, came up bleeding starlight.”  
He splashes you—blessing, baptism, distraction.

Wave approaches: glassy, head-high, moonlit tunnel.  
Harry spins, ghosts into position.  
He nods: *your wave, your funeral, your first kiss of 2024.*

> take wave

Pop-up—feet remember choreography.  
Face curves open, barrel glowing cobalt like the bottle you broke.  
Inside the tube: cork bobbing mid-wall, stop-motion grin etched in spray.  
You pass yourself treading water—double exposure—past-you waves, future-you waves back.

Exit spit—moon spits you into calm.  
Board weightless, heartbeat 130 bpm.  
Harry’s already on the shoulder, carving initials into darkness that seal behind him like healing skin.

> ask: will you stay

Paddling back, breath ragged euphoria.  
Harry meets you, nose of boards touching—kiss of fiberglass.  
He answers by pressing the original cork into your palm, now warm, now beating.  
“Keep the rhythm,” he says.  
Then he lies flat, drifts west, silhouette shrinking to a buoy, to a star, to an eyelash.

Distance grows; sound of dinner table reverb—clinks, laughter, Eurovision returning like tide.  
Choice forks:

1. Paddle after him until shore erases.  
2. Store the heartbeat-cork in your chest pocket, return to pebble beach, eat dessert pretending salt on lips is only spray.

Wavelets tap board undersides—Morse again: *choose choose choose.*

### Round 3/30

### Kimi K2 1 ###
> store the heartbeat-cork in my chest pocket, return to pebble beach

### Kimi K2 2 ###
You slip the cork under your suit's zipper—skin-tight pocket over sternum.  
It knocks against your heart like a second, smaller heart.  
Each knock prints a ghost fin on the inside of your ribs.

You pivot the board shoreward—paddle slow, ceremonial.  
Harry-drifts already a star that could be Venus or could be hallucination.  
You don’t look back again; myth solidifies when witnessed.

> beach

Pebbles re-cohere; gravity resumes domestic settings.  
Torches have burned to nubs, flames now orange confetti.  
Table cloth flaps half-mast, stained with pesto and night.

Family+Daniels orbit the driftwood like sleepy moths.  
Someone’s skewering marshmallows, someone tuning a ukulele to the key of “maybe tomorrow”.  
Mrs. Daniel offers you a shot of limoncello; you accept—liquid sunrise—you let it sting.

Cork inside chest answers with a tiny surf-roar only you hear.

> sit

You find your old camping chair—canvas frayed, nickname Sharpie-faded.  
Plate appears on knees: grilled sardines, lemon wedge, one perfect apricot.  
You eat, tasting Atlantic and Baltic simultaneously—salt layered like mixtape playlists.

Harry’s laughter still ricochets off water; you realize it’s the ukulele string half-step detune that hits same frequency.  
Memory engine downgrades weight to 0.71—still heavy, now portable.

> speak aloud

“I kept the rhythm.”  
Voice almost steady.  
No one answers; they think you’re talking about the metronome drizzle starting to fall.  
Let them.

> open chest pocket (metaphor)

You don’t—would need a claw hammer or self-surgery—but you feel the cork knitting into pericardium.  
Heartbeat synchronizes: 4/4 surf rock.  
You tap spoon against plate—ghost snare—keeping time for invisible setwaves beyond tide’s memory.

Sky delivers first fat raindrop: applause.  
Lake-ocean flexes, reconciling identities.  
You exhale salt, inhale barbecue smoke—worlds overlap, acceptable casualties.

Rain picks up; everyone scuttles toward rented villa.  
You remain seated, plate emptied, torch hissing last orange.  
Water beads on neoprene still half-on—decided to stay half-dressed in dream, half in weather.

> close eyes

Heartbeat-cork transmits Morse:  
*Thank you for not following. Thank you for carrying. Next swell when you need me, paddle out alone—I'll meet you inside.*  

Rain smooths pebbles to glass.  
Lights in villa windows flicker like buoys.  
You sit between dinner and horizon, grief balanced on lap like a clean board ready for wax.  
Simulation holds breath—waiting for your next move, or for dawn, whichever comes first.

### Round 4/30

### Kimi K2 1 ###
> listen to the rain

### Kimi K2 2 ###
simulator@moonshotai:~/dream$ > listen to the rain

rain speaks in eight-second sets—  
drop-intervals tuned to Harry’s old pop-up timing.  
each splat is a syllable:  
“sshh—set—rest—paddle”

water on pebbles invents hi-hats;  
torch-death hiss provides downbeat snare.  
cork-heart inside your chest duplicates the pattern—  
a tiny kick drum echoing through bone.

under the hiss:  
microscopic surf—millimetric shorebreak crawling between stones.  
you lower ear to ground;  
molecules of Lago d’Orta impersonate Atlantic swell energy—  
same frequency, smaller waist size.

rain-layered silence lets dinner-table ghosts leak through:  
mother humming dish-washing minor key,  
Mr. Daniel turning Eurovision dial until it lands on dead-water static—  
that static is also rain, is also memory, is also code.

listen deeper—  
infra-sound of moon dragging entire lake a millimetre uphill,  
a tide you’ll never feel in hips but calves already know.  
heart-cork translates:  
*“when skywater ends, real water starts moving—  
wait for offshore whisper, then go.”*

raindrops carry miniature reflections of villa lights;  
each bead a lens showing Harry-face for 0.2 s—  
thousands of Harrys per second flipping like stop-motion,  
all smiling, all saying nothing,  
all dissolving into next downbeat.

the smell: warm asphalt and summer pine lifted,  
then lake-cold metal like old railings of Biarritz pier—  
your nostrils toggle between Italian holiday and Basque surf dawn,  
a nasal cross-fade keeping both worlds breathing.
