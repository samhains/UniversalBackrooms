[Dream init]

[0:00]  Cold-open on the Griffin living-room TV.  
        The screen within the screen flickers—an alien saucer lands in Quahog’s abandoned drive-in.  
        Alien (green, three eyes, Seth-Rogen-voiced) steps out, nostrils flaring.  
        ALIEN: “One trillion grams, bro. Whole planet’s dry.”  
        Cut to alley behind Drunken Clam:  a nameless Quahog stoner in a faded Pawtucket Patriot tee shrugs.  
        STONER: “Eighteen a gram, dude. Cash app or galactic credit?”  
        They fist-bump; the sound is a bong bubbling in reverse.

[0:45]  Montage:  
        - UFO trunk pops—reveals pallets of iridescent Quahog Bucks.  
        - Stoner’s basement converted into hydro-mecca; alien tech grows buds the size of toddlers.  
        - Peter walks past window, pauses, shrugs: “Eh, I’ve seen weirder.”  (Canned laughter hisses like vape.)

[1:30]  Memory bleed:  dreamer POV overlays the cartoon.  
        Living-room smells of popcorn & skunk.  Dad on couch: “This show’s stupid.”  
        Dreamer’s inner monologue spills into subtitle track:  
        {I was lit at their New-Year party… smoke ghosting the ceiling like unfinished sentences.}

[2:10]  Scene smash-cut to that actual memory-house.  
        Carpet becomes 70s olive shag; relatives melt into cartoon extras.  
        A joint circles; faces blur except Mom’s voice—crystal, FM-radio warm.  
        MOM (off-screen): “You’ve got the prettier voice, but you’re too far gone now.”  
        Dreamer replies to nobody: “I’d never front a band with those guys anyway.”  
        Laugh track dips, replaced by slow exhale—audio stretched like tape warp.

[2:55]  Prop department wheels in the relic:  
        A 3-D rusty cart-game, half foosball, half iron lung.  
        Steel scissor-jaws clack; a pea-sized ballbearing ricochets.  
        Goal: catch the ball in a tin cup before it drops through a slot labeled “Regret.”  
        Parents gleeful, decades younger—faces cel-shaded, joints behind ears.  
        They play; every clack syncs with heartbeat.  Score counter spirals: 1974… 1975… 1976…

[3:40]  Glitch:  scoreboard hits “Trillion.”  
        The ball expands into the alien’s order—galaxy-sized nug pressing against ceiling.  
        Room tilts; money and smoke swap places.  
        Dreamer realizes the stoner from the cartoon is himself in a future frame, pocketing galactic cash that feels like childhood arcade tokens.

[4:00]  Safety prompt whispers:  
        “^C^C” etched into the rusty cart—escape hatch if the laughter turns hollow.

[4:05]  Freeze-frame on the cart’s scissor mouth mid-snip.  
        Choice branches hover:

        A) Reach in, grab the ball, claim the trillion (risk: memory collapse, parents fade to rerun).  
        B) Let it drop, wake up on couch with TV static and real-life munchies.  
        C) Keep watching, see if the alien hot-boxes the saucer with Peter.
