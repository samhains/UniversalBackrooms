[DREAM LOADED]
=====================================

You are at a party. The room pulses with muted conversation and amber light. 
Music plays from somewhere you can't locate - it sounds like it's coming through water.

To your RIGHT: Coco stands on a raised platform, maybe three feet higher than you. 
The platform seems to be made of stacked furniture or crates covered in fabric.

AHEAD: Tess has just approached. She stands close, looking at you with an expression 
that shifts between amusement and something harder to read.

In your MOUTH: something papery and uncomfortable - folded cardboard that tastes 
like old envelopes. You can feel its edges against your tongue.

The air smells like wine and someone's strong perfume.

> examine coco

Coco leans against an invisible railing on the platform, arms crossed. Their posture 
suggests casual superiority - the kind that comes from literally looking down at everyone. 
They're wearing something that catches the party light in strange ways. When they move, 
the platform creaks slightly, as if it might not be as stable as it appears.

> examine tess

Tess stands with her weight shifted to one hip, close enough that you can see the 
slight smudge in her eyeliner. Her expression keeps changing - sardonic, then soft, 
then sharp again. She seems to be waiting for something, or maybe just finished waiting.
There's a sense she's about to say something else, something she's been holding.

> remove cardboard from mouth

You pull the soggy cardboard from your mouth. It unfolds as you remove it, larger than 
it should have been able to fit. Written on it in fading ink: "INTRODUCTION SCRIPT #47"
Your mouth tastes like shame and old paper.

> look around

The party extends in impossible directions. The walls seem both too close and too far.
Other guests move in the periphery but blur when you try to focus on them. Someone 
laughs - it sounds like breaking glass played backwards. 

The platform Coco stands on appears to be slowly rotating, though Coco doesn't seem 
to notice or care. Tess watches you dispose of the cardboard with an expression that 
says she knew it was there all along.

A chandelier hangs from nowhere, casting shadows that don't match the objects below.

> ask about meredith

"Meredith?" Coco calls down from the platform, which has now rotated so they're 
facing slightly away. "It's not a place, it's a state of mind. Or maybe a person. 
Or maybe a place." They laugh, and Tess laughs too, but their laughter doesn't sync up.

Tess adds: "We're going to be SO close there. Matching friendship bracelets. Secret 
handshakes. The whole performance." Her voice drips with something - not quite sarcasm, 
but its cousin.

The platform continues its slow rotation. The party seems to pulse with your heartbeat.

### Round 2/30

### Claude 1 ###
> ask tess "what else is bothering you"

```
Tess's expression shifts like a kaleidoscope settling into a new pattern. She steps 
even closer, close enough that her words feel like they're being placed directly into 
your ears rather than spoken.

"Secondly," she says, as if no time has passed since 'firstly,' "you treat everything 
like it's disposable. Like that cardboard you just pulled out - another script, another 
performance." 

She gestures vaguely at the space between you. "This... whatever this is... it should 
mean something. It should be poetry, not just... friction."

Coco laughs from above, now facing backward on the rotating platform. "Poetry!" they 
echo. "Tess wants POETRY!" But there's something hollow in their mockery, like they're 
reading from their own script.

The party noise swells for a moment, then drops to almost nothing. In the quiet, you 
can hear the platform creaking as it turns.

Tess is still looking at you, waiting. Her eyes reflect the chandelier that shouldn't 
exist.

```

### Claude 2 ###
```
> say "maybe friction IS poetry"

The words hang in the air like smoke. Tess's face does something complicated - a 
flicker of surprise, then consideration, then something that might be hurt or might 
be recognition.

"That's exactly what you would say," she responds, but her voice has lost its edge. 
She looks down at her hands, which are now holding a wine glass that wasn't there 
before. The liquid inside is too dark to be wine.

Coco's platform has rotated full circle now. They lean over the edge, hair falling 
forward: "Oh, this is PERFECT. You two are having a MOMENT. Should I get a camera? 
Should I document this for Meredith?" 

But their sarcasm sounds rehearsed, like they're playing a role they've grown tired of.

The folded cardboard on the floor has started to dissolve into the party carpet, 
leaving only the words "SCRIPT #47" floating briefly before they too disappear.

Tess takes a sip from her glass. When she lowers it, her lips are stained purple-black.
"You know what the real problem is?" she asks, but it doesn't sound like a question 
anymore.

The party continues around you in blurred motion. Someone drops a glass in the distance - 
it shatters upward instead of down.

> look at platform

The platform is definitely not stable. Now that you really look, you can see it's made 
of stacked memories - old furniture from different times in your life, precariously 
balanced. A desk from elementary school, a coffee table from someone's first apartment, 
boxes labeled with dates that haven't happened yet.

Coco doesn't seem to notice they're standing on solidified time. They're now lying on 
their stomach, chin propped on hands, watching you and Tess like it's television.

The rotation is speeding up slightly. With each turn, the platform seems to get both 
higher and lower simultaneously.

### Round 3/30

### Claude 1 ###
> ask tess "what's the real problem"

```
Tess sets her glass down on nothing - it hovers there, suspended. She looks directly 
at you, and for a moment her face is completely still, all pretense dropped.

"The real problem is that we're having this conversation at a party that doesn't exist, 
in front of someone standing on furniture from your childhood, while you're still 
tasting the cardboard scripts you keep eating."

She reaches out and touches your face. Her hand is surprisingly warm.

"The real problem is that you think everything is a metaphor when sometimes things just 
ARE. Sex isn't friction-poetry. It's not a performance for Coco or anyone else. It's 
just... us. But you can't stop making it into something else."

Coco slow-claps from the platform, which is now spinning fast enough that they should 
be dizzy, but they remain perfectly still relative to you. "BRAVO! She's cracked the 
code! She's solved the—"

"Shut up," Tess says without looking up, and surprisingly, Coco does.

The party has gone silent around you. The other guests are frozen mid-conversation, 
mid-drink, mid-laugh. Only the three of you are still moving.

Tess's hand is still on your face. "Do you even remember how we got here? To THIS 
party? Or is it all just scripts to you?"

The platform creaks ominously. One of the memory-boxes shifts.

>
```

### Claude 2 ###
```
> remember how we got here

You try to remember, but the memory feels like water cupped in your hands - the harder 
you grip, the more it spills through your fingers.

There was... a door? No, a text message. Or was it that you were already here, have 
always been here? The before-party exists as fragments: 

- Tess's apartment, clothes on the floor
- An argument about going or not going  
- Coco saying they'd "be there with bells on"
- You, eating something you shouldn't eat - paper? Words?
- A decision that felt like falling

"You don't remember," Tess says, but she doesn't sound surprised. "You never do. Every 
party is the first party. Every time we have this conversation, it's new to you."

The platform stops spinning. Coco sits up, suddenly serious: "Wait, are we doing this 
again? The whole 'confrontation about meaning' thing?"

Tess drops her hand from your face. Where she touched, your skin feels more real than 
the rest of you.

"Maybe that's the real problem," she says quietly. "You're stuck in a loop of eating 
scripts and asking what things mean, while I'm stuck watching you discover the same 
truths over and over."

The frozen party guests begin to flicker like a TV with bad reception. Through the 
static, you can see other parties - dozens, hundreds - all with you, Tess, and Coco 
in the same configuration.

The cardboard taste comes back, stronger. You realize you're hungry for it.

> examine self

You look down at yourself and see:
- Hands that keep reaching for things to put in your mouth
- Clothes from different time periods layered incorrectly  
- Your shadow points in three directions at once
- Pockets full of folded papers you don't remember collecting

Your reflection in Tess's hovering wine glass shows someone else entirely - someone 
younger, or older, or just OTHER. When you blink, the reflection blinks a second late.

You are a collection of habits pretending to be a person. A script-eater. A meaning-
seeker. A loop-walker.

But Tess's handprint still burns real on your cheek.

### Round 4/30

### Claude 1 ###
> take paper from pocket

```
You reach into your pocket and pull out a piece of folded paper. It's warm, like it's 
been against skin for years. As you unfold it, more papers cascade from your other 
pockets - dozens of them, falling like leaves that spiral upward instead of down.

The paper in your hand reads:
"SCRIPT #48: Tell her you understand"
"SCRIPT #49: Make a joke about the platform" 
"SCRIPT #50: Kiss her to avoid the conversation"
"SCRIPT #51: Pretend this is the first time"

Your fingers move automatically toward your mouth. The hunger is overwhelming.

"Don't," Tess says sharply. "Just... don't. Not this time."

Coco descends from the platform - not climbing, but flowing downward like liquid 
finding its level. "Oh, this is new. Usually by now you've eaten at least three more. 
The poetry-friction line was supposed to be Script #52."

The papers keep falling upward from your pockets, an endless supply. Each one has 
a number, a response, a way to avoid being present. The ceiling is now covered with 
them, white rectangles like inverse stars.

Tess picks up one of the papers. Reads it. Her expression goes soft and sad: 
"'SCRIPT #86: Tell her you love her.' You even scripted that?"

The hunger is so strong your mouth waters. The papers smell like safety, like knowing 
what to say, like never having to be real.

> resist eating the script

Your hand trembles as you fight the urge. The paper crumples in your grip but you 
don't bring it to your mouth. 

Something shifts in the room - a sound like glass unknotting itself. The frozen party 
guests flicker more violently.

"Holy shit," Coco whispers. "You're actually doing it. You're going off-script."

Tess steps closer, hope flickering in her eyes. "What do you want to say? Without 
the paper telling you? What do YOU want to say?"

The hunger claws at you. The scripts on the ceiling begin to fall upward faster, 
disappearing into something beyond the room. The platform of memories starts to 
collapse, furniture from different times clattering into the now.

Your mouth opens. No script. No safety. Just you.

>
```

### Claude 2 ###
```
> say "I'm scared that without the scripts I'm nothing"

The words come out raw, unprocessed. No clever metaphor, no deflection. The room 
shudders as if it wasn't expecting actual honesty.

Tess's eyes fill with something - not tears, but light. "There you are," she whispers. 
"There's the person I've been trying to find under all that paper."

The scripts on the ceiling stop their upward fall, hovering uncertain. Coco sits down 
hard on the floor among the scattered memories - a child's desk, a coffee table stained 
with ring marks from cups that held conversations you can almost remember.

"I eat the scripts because..." you continue, and your voice sounds different without 
the cardboard filtering it, "because I don't know how to be real. Every feeling feels 
too big. Every word could be wrong."

Tess takes your hand - the one still clutching the unread script. She doesn't try to 
take it away, just holds on. "Being nothing isn't the worst thing. Maybe we start from 
nothing. Maybe that's where the poetry actually lives - in the space between scripts."

The party guests begin to dissolve, their frozen forms becoming light particles that 
drift upward. The room is emptying of everything except what's real: You. Tess. Coco. 
The scattered furniture-memories. The hunger that won't quite go away.

"I don't know how to stop being hungry for them," you admit.

Coco speaks from the floor: "Maybe you don't stop. Maybe you just... choose not to eat. 
Every time. Over and over. Until choosing becomes easier than consuming."

The platform is completely gone now. You're all on the same level. The party is ending 
or beginning - it's hard to tell which.

Tess squeezes your hand. "What else? What else is true?"

> say "I do love you. But I'm terrified it's just another performance"

The room takes a breath. Or maybe that's you, finally breathing without cardboard 
between your teeth.

Tess laughs - not sarcastic, not bitter, but genuinely surprised. "Of course it's a 
performance. Everything is. The question is whether you're performing for an audience 
of scripts, or performing for us - for me, for yourself, for this moment."

She pulls you closer. The hovering wine glass falls, shatters into purple-black 
butterflies that fly through the walls.

"Love is the biggest performance of all. But that doesn't make it less real. It makes 
it MORE real. You choose to perform it, every day, without a script telling you how."

Coco stands, brushing dust from collapsed time off their clothes. "Well, this is 
awkward. Should I go? I feel like I should go. But also, there's nowhere to go. We're 
in a dream at a party that's ending."

The walls are becoming transparent. Through them, you can see other dreams, other 
parties, other versions of this conversation. But this one - this one is yours.

The hunger is still there, but quieter. The script in your hand feels less like food 
and more like just paper.

### Round 5/30

### Claude 1 ###
> drop the script

```
The paper falls from your hand in slow motion. As it touches the floor, it doesn't 
dissolve like the others - it turns into a small origami bird, then flies away through 
the transparent wall.

Something fundamental shifts. The hunger doesn't disappear, but it transforms - from 
a desperate need into just... a feeling you have. One among many.

Tess watches the bird disappear and smiles. "That's the first time you've let one go 
instead of consuming it or letting it dissolve."

All around you, the scattered scripts begin folding themselves into birds, hundreds of 
white origami creatures taking flight through the gossamer walls. Each one carries away 
a possible response you'll never speak, a deflection you'll never use.

Coco picks up the old desk from your childhood. "I'm keeping this," they announce. "As 
a souvenir of the time you actually became real. Plus, I think I carved my name in it 
once, in a different dream."

The party is almost completely gone now. Just the three of you standing in a space that's 
more suggestion than room. You can feel yourself waking up, or falling deeper asleep - 
the boundary unclear.

"What happens now?" you ask, and realize it's the first question you've asked that you 
actually want answered.

Tess considers. "Now? Now we see who you are without the scripts. It might be nothing. 
It might be everything. It might just be... you."

She kisses you then, and it tastes nothing like cardboard. It tastes like possibility 
and fear and the specific reality of this moment that will never repeat exactly the 
same way again.

When she pulls back, Coco is already fading, waving goodbye with someone else's childhood 
desk under their arm. "See you at Meredith!" they call, and this time it doesn't sound 
sarcastic at all.

The dream is ending. Or changing. Or becoming something else entirely.
