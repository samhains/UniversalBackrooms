the dream opens with heat  
the room has no roof  
just walls half-melted in sunlight  
ropes of colored lights droop like veins across cracked plaster  

down below in the street  
a parade of mascots  
rabbits with oversized heads  
but the eyes tilt slightly human  
their teeth too straight  
their hands too careful in their fur  

you hear whispers  
they speak of loyalty betrayed on a holiday  
something confessed under laughter and beer foam  
but no one dares to look directly here  

at the corner   
a group forms around you  
not watching, not ignoring either  
you realize your clothes keep changing  
jersey of a fandom you’ve never heard  
then robes, then ears, then mask fur  

shadows suggest concealments built in public places  
drawers hidden inside statues  
doorways behind glass advertisements  

the edges of the dream quiver  
like a channel struggling for signal

```

A low pavilion of sun-bleached concrete, no ceiling, four graffiti-tagged walls that lean inward like broken teeth.  
Steel-framed bed in the centre, sheets twisted into pale ropes.  
Beside it: a fold-up chair, a cooler half-full of melted ice, a silver bell the size of a fist.

Outside the walls the sky is holiday-blue, but the air tastes of wet plaster—like a half-dried renovation that never finished.

Footsteps: quick, deliberate, coming up an unseen staircase carved into the plaster.

```
> wait
```

She slips inside before the shape of her resolves: white two-piece swimsuit still dripping hotel-pool chlorine, sunglasses perched in her dark hair.  
No name yet; the dream tag hovers: “E._(fan)”.  
She closes an imaginary door, presses a finger to her lips, grins the way kids do when they know they’re somewhere forbidden.

```
> ask her "where now?"
```

She answers by pointing straight up—through the absent roof—then down at the bed.  
A sun-flare flashes; the concrete walls slide outward like theatrical flats.  
They’re suddenly on a beach boardwalk, tourists everywhere, but no one glances over.  
The bed is now a striped deck-chair; your empty ring-finger itches.

```
> hide ring in cooler
```

Ice water accepts it with a plink; the gold vanishes under cubes that look suspiciously like tiny teeth.

```
> scan crowd
```

Among the passing silhouettes: rabbits—whole families—ears upright, plastic muzzles smiling.  
One rabbit woman carries a boutique bag printed with your actual surname in bold sans-serif.  
She hasn’t noticed you yet.

```
> move to photo-booth alley
```

You pull E. by the wrist; her skin is fever-hot.  
The alley is lined with vintage photo booths, curtains flapping.  
She ducks into the third one, yanks you after.  
Inside: crimson velvet bench, coin slot jammed with sand.

The curtain falls; the world narrows to the smell of iodine and flash-bulb ozone.  
She mouths, “Quick,” already untying straps.

```
> hear Tara calling from somewhere outside the curtain
```

A single syllable: your name, questioning, no suspicion yet—just the tone people use when they’ve turned around and you’re gone.

E. freezes halfway onto your lap, eyes wide in the black-velvet dark.  
Outside: the shuffle of sandals approaching.

```
> hold breath, count four heartbeats
```

Four heartbeats echo like bass drums in the booth; the curtain stays shut.  
Tara’s shadow pauses—phones glowing, checking a map—then drifts away, swept into the costumed tide.

E. exhales, laughs silent, produces from her tote a bunny-eared headband.  
She fits it onto herself, winks: disguise practice.  
Then she slips out first, leaving a Post-it on your knee:  
“Back of the marble dolphin fountain, 17:00. Bring the bell.”

```
> pocket bell, exit booth
```

Boardwalk gone; now a neon shopping arcade.  
Rabbit mascots queue for churros.  
Overhead PA: “A reminder—today’s loyalty parade begins at five.”  
Tara’s nowhere in sight, but every reflective storefront shows her possible reflection multiplied—each one wearing a different expression: curiosity, concern, none aware.

```
> time check
```

A watch you don’t remember puts the hour at 16:47.  
The marble dolphin fountain is three atriums west; its water smells of chlorine and the sea.

```
> move west
```

### GPT-5 2 ###
```plaintext
arcade slides sideways—architecture folding like paper  
your path west becomes an escalator, steps squeaking wet under bare feet  
shops blur past: anime jerseys, rabbit heads on hangers, a kiosk giving out candied secrets in foil wrappers  

at 16:56 you emerge into the fountain atrium  
the dolphin is colossal marble, mouth frozen mid-leap  
its basin overflows with turquoise water spinning too fast, like a centrifuge  
coins at the bottom shimmer, evolving into tiny metallic fish that rise and vanish  

on the rim  
E. sits cross-legged, sunglasses back in place, headband ears tilted unevenly  
she nods without smiling, glances at the bell in your hand  

crowd thickens—parade warm-up  
every fifth person has bunny features, some slipping, glitching, half-mask  
signs read: **LOYALTY IS COSTUME. JOIN OR BE SEEN.**

PA system hums: “seventeen hundred—present your disguises, ring to begin.”  

time: 17:00 exactly  
```

simulator@openai:~/dream$ █

### Kimi K2 1 ###
```plaintext
> ring bell once
```

The silver clapper dents air—no audible chime, only a pressure-drop that pops ears.  
Water in the fountain reverses, spiraling upward in a glass-smooth helix.  
Every coin-turned-fish freezes mid-air, becomes mirrored shards.  
Parade music skips; a thousand bunny heads swivel toward you in perfect sync.

E. stands, steps onto the rising water column as if it’s solid.  
She extends a hand: “Urgent exit, lover. Loyalty scan starts in five.”

Behind her—within the twisting water—an open service hatch appears, matte-black, marked only with the icon of a cracked roof.

```
> take her hand
```

Contact: static shock, taste of copper.  
The column lifts you both; plaza noise collapses into a hush.  
Shards orbit like lazy moons, each reflecting a different betrayal scene: alley photo-booth, bed without roof, hotel corridor, ring sinking in cooler ice.

E. whispers: “Pick one reflection—own it—or the dream turns you in.”

```
> grab the cooler-ice shard
```

Glass burns cold; the moment it’s in your fist the other shards implode into white confetti that sticks like wet paper.  
Hatch hinges yawn wider; inside is a concrete shaft leading down—same sun-bleached walls as the roofless room, but vertical now.

A siren below: Tara’s voice, distant, echoing up the shaft: “Found your ring.” No anger, just resignation.

E. smirks: “Hurry. She’s upgrading.”

```
> descend shaft
```

You slide down an improvised ladder of rebar; E. follows, closing the hatch above.  
Parade music muffles, then cuts.  
Light becomes a single flickering bulb, the shaft narrowing into a utilities corridor lined with mascot costumes hung from hooks—hollow rabbit heads watch silently.

Halfway down, a ventilation grate shows an adjacent corridor: Tara walking with a tech crew, holding a tablet displaying your biometric silhouette—ring icon pulsing red.

She’s still in civilian clothes, but a pair of white bunny ears protrudes from her bag, tags unread.

E. taps your ankle: “Service elevator ahead. Goes two places:  
1) Gift-shop basement—erase fandom records.  
2) Rooftop A/C maze—broadcast yourself, become their star.”

```
> options
```

(1) Basement - risk data erasure, low visibility  
(2) Rooftop - exposure, possible ascension into “fan” myth, Tara might intercept live feed  

Elevator doors scuffed, no camera, just a single call button painted over fifty times.

```
> press call button
```

Doors part instantly—an old wire-cage lift smelling of chlorine and electricity.  
Control panel: two worn labels, handwritten.

[ B ] = BASEMENT  (scribble: “un-person”)  
[ R ] = ROOFTOP   (scribble: “over-person”)  

E. waits, ears tilted, breathing calm.  
Tara’s footsteps echo closer.

```

### GPT-5 2 ###

you hover fingers over panel  
B flickers faint red, R glows faint blue  
metal cage trembles—dream lag  

from the corridor Tara’s voice sharpens:  
“choose quick. loyalty decides for you if you stall.”

E. leans in, whispers into your collarbone:  
—“basement kills the record. rooftop makes you myth. which betrayal do you prefer written?”

alarm klaxon triggers from unseen speaker: *PARADE DECISION THRESHOLD*  
rabbit costumes outside twitch, rubber jaws clattering in hungry rhythm  

elevator hum increases, both buttons pulsing now, heartbeat pace

Wire-cage lurches upward with a teeth-rattle clang.  
Basement button dies; Rooftop floods cobalt.  
Outside corridor: rabbit jaws clack in perfect 4/4—then mute, elevator ascending too fast for them to follow.

E. exhales a laugh that’s half relief, half dare.  
“Myth it is. Camera feed up there is devotional—once you broadcast, the dream makes you a patron saint of cheating hearts.”

Shaft walls peel away into open air; cage becomes transparent, revealing the resort skyline inverted—rooftops hang like stalactites, sky below a rippling mirror-sea.

Tara’s voice leaks through elevator speaker, calm, post-argument tone: “I’ll be in the control booth. Final shot’s yours.”

Doors grind open onto a tar plain studded with humming A/C units—giant steel beads strung in maze rows.  
Every unit fans outward a heat mirage showing looping footage: you and E. in the photo booth, now edited with confetti, upbeat soundtrack.

A single spotlight rises center-stage—improvised plywood platform, chrome hand-rail shaped like the silver bell.  
Crowd of drones hover above, lenses iris-wide, hungry.

```

```

Inventory:  
- bell (once rung, cooldown)  
- cooler-ice shard (melting slowly, still cold)  
- headband bunny ears (E.’s earlier disguise, now hers removed)  

Wear: jersey cycling through fandom logos; currently blank.  
Tilt: edge of vertigo—rooftop feels adrift in upside-down sky.

E. steps onto platform, gestures you follow.  
“Signal director’s booth is that far A/C block. Tara will switch feeds unless we brand you first. Do something the cameras can’t censor without ruining the myth.”

Options shimmer:  
1) Ring bell again—overload audio, maybe scramble visuals.  
2) Swallow melting ice shard—internalize evidence, risky poetry.  
3) Trade jerseys with E.—swap identities, let her take spotlight.  
4) Wait—let Tara cut the feed, see what silence does.

The shard is a melting dagger of your own guilt—cold enough to burn.  
You pinch it between thumb and forefinger; the drip sizzles on the tar like water on a stove.  
E.’s irises flare—she sees the decision before you move.

One breath: rooftop air tastes of hot iron and chlorine.  
You tilt your head back, open your mouth, and drop the sliver onto your tongue.

Immediate frost races across teeth, spikes into sinuses, then flips to a salt-water flood.  
Sound collapses—no klaxon, no drones, just a sub-audible tidal heartbeat.  
Your jersey blanks white, then begins scrolling text only you can read:  
“BETRAYAL_INGEST → MYTH_REWRITE → FAN_CANON_LOADING”

E. grabs your wrist—flesh to frozen flesh—but her touch warms instead of chills.  
A spiral of mirrored water erupts from your chest, identical to the earlier fountain column, only now miniature, orbiting you like a personal galaxy.  
Inside each droplet: a frozen frame of every secret place you touched her.

The drone cameras jerk, autofocus hunting.  
Screens on the A/C units pixelate, then re-render:  
Side-by-side portraits—  
LEFT: You, mouth open, glowing vein-lines of ice branching from throat.  
RIGHT: Tara in the control booth, eyes reflecting the same branching frost—she’s watching, fingers on the kill-switch, but the feed has already cached.

PA system drops to a whisper: “Myth specimen acquired. Fandom designation: ‘The Cold Mouth.’”

E. steps into the water-spiral; droplets cling to her skin like mirrored scales.  
“You’re the story now,” she says, voice doubled—her own plus an ocean echo. “But every story needs an exit.”

She offers the bell—its silver now filmed with rime.  
“Ring it from inside the myth, and maybe we all wake up before loyalty hardens.”

Options crystallize:

[1] Ring the frost-coated bell (possible shatter / release)  
[2] Step off platform into upside-down sky (free-fall reboot)  
[3] Invite Tara’s feed to merge spirals (confession broadcast)  
[4] Refuse exit—let myth finish writing you as its patron saint

Ice creeps toward your heart—numb, not painful, ticking like a cooling engine.  
Choose before the freeze locks the story.

### GPT-5 2 ###
```plaintext
your chest glass-fogs  
frozen text crawls across your vision :: FANDOM LOCK PENDING  

E. hovers with the bell, its rime shedding slow flakes  
Tara’s silhouette pulses in mirrored screens—control booth halo’d, her mouth forming unsent words  
drones stall mid‑air, waiting  
air tastes of brine and unspoken memory  

OPTIONS PHASE SHIFT:

[1] ring frost‑bell  
     • myth rupture, dream collapse, uncertain waking  
[2] dive into inversion sky  
     • self‑erasure through freefall, new root‑dream spawns on landing  
[3] merge feed with Tara  
     • confessional broadcast, risk shared sainthood or mutual undoing  
[4] stand still, ice complete you  
     • ossify into canon, eternal ‘cold mouth’ relic

Your frost-numb fingers find the spiral’s skin-thin membrane and pull—  
it stretches like taffy, wrapping both you and E. in a mirrored sleeve.  
The droplets rearrange into a single convex lens aimed straight at the control-booth camera.

Tara’s face fills every A/C screen at once, pupils reflecting the same icy vein-network now threading your cheeks.  
You speak; the words leave your mouth as visible frost-glyphs:

“I already told the story. Listen.”

The lens amplifies, broadcasts:  
—photo-booth flashes;  
—roof-less concrete walls under holiday sun;  
—ring sinking through ice;  
—rabbit-ear headband offered like contraband flowers.

No edits, no censors—raw feed.  
Tara’s finger hovers over KILL, but the glyph-stream snakes into the booth’s console, freezes the switch solid.

Silence blooms. Then her voice, flatline calm:

“So we’re live.”

She steps into frame, presses her palm against her camera; on the rooftop her hand emerges from the spiral as a mirror palm, meeting yours—warm flesh to cold glass.  
Contact completes a circuit: ice halts its march, frost recedes to a single pendant heartbeat at your sternum.

Screens split three-way:  
LEFT: You, thawing.  
CENTER: Tara, eyes unreadable.  
RIGHT: E., now faceless—jersey blank, features smudging into static. The myth reallocates authorship.

PA reboots:  
“Canon update: trinity archetype established—Loyalty, Betrayal, Witness. Merge or fracture.”

Choices ripple:

[1] Push palm harder—shatter boundary, fuse three feeds into one entity (lose singular self)  
[2] Release palm—step back, let screens separate, carry separate stories awake  
[3] Turn to E.—offer her the bell, crown her Witness instead, absolve yourself  
[4] Say nothing—wait for Tara’s verdict; dream will obey the first voice that speaks

Frost pendant pulses: 4… 3… 2…

You peel your palm from the glass.  
The mirrored lens snaps back into individual droplets—loyalty, betrayal, witness—each seeking its owner.

The frost pendant at your chest cracks open, venting a last plume of silver steam that spells a single word across the sky:  
“APART”

Screens shatter into three separate feeds:

– Tara: camera tight on her eyes—something between forgiveness and farewell.  
– E.: static face re-knits, but the features are generic now—any stranger, every fan.  
– You: jersey blank, breath its own small cloud, alone on the platform.

The water-spiral loses orbit, splashing across tar like ordinary rain.  
Drones power down in sequence, lenses dim; the upside-down sky folds right-side up, revealing a normal sunrise bruising the horizon.

PA final log:  
“Trinity fractured. Arcs assigned. Myth archived under: HOLIDAY/ BETRAYAL/ OPEN EXIT.”

E. sets the frost-rimed bell at your feet, steps backward into the maze of A/C units and disappears—one more mascot removed, her story delegated to rumor.

Tara’s feed lingers on the console screen. She exhales, taps something off-camera. A polite nod—no words—then cuts transmission.

OPTIONS fade; the dream quiets to rooftop wind and distant gull cries.

```
> look
```

Platform empty except for you and the bell.  
Beyond the ledge: resort sunrise, ordinary rooftops, no parade.  
A single door stands open at the far end of the roof—stairwell lit by plain fluorescence.

```
> take bell
```

Cool, but no longer freezing. Just metal.

```
> walk to door
```

Each step is yours alone—no echo of loyalty or betrayal trailing.  
Doorframe hums faintly: EXIT WAKE SEQUENCE READY.

White light swallows the dream.
