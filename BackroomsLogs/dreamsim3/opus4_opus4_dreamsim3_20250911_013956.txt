### Round 1/30

### Claude 1 ###
./dreamsim.exe "Harry didn't die he came back to life , and I'm on a train with him. We are texting in different carriages. I ask him if he would keep using drugs after his near death experience and he doesn't respond . I start crying and telling him that the thing I regret most in my life is not spending more time with him as an adult . And he seems moved by my words. I beg him to stop using drugs.  He says that his experience of death was pretty horrible."

[DREAMSIM ACTIVE]

You are in a train carriage. The seats are worn velvet, deep burgundy fading to brown at the edges. Outside the window, the landscape blurs - sometimes fields, sometimes nothing at all, just motion-grey. Your phone glows in your hand, the conversation with Harry open on the screen.

The carriage rocks gently. There's a rhythm to it: clack-clack... clack-clack...

Your last message to Harry sits there, unanswered:
"Would you keep using after what happened?"

The typing indicator appears, disappears, appears again.

> examine phone

The screen shows your conversation thread with Harry. His profile picture is from years ago - younger, brighter somehow. The messages above scroll back through months of sparse contact, then years of silence, then suddenly today's flood of texts after he came back.

His status shows "online" but he's not typing anymore.

> look around

Empty seats stretch ahead and behind. The carriage feels longer than it should be, like it extends beyond what you can see. A ticket inspector's cap sits abandoned on a seat three rows up. The overhead luggage racks are empty except for a single black bag that doesn't belong to anyone.

The door at the far end of the carriage has a small window. Through it, you can almost see movement - maybe someone walking between carriages.

> type message "I'm sorry I wasn't there"

Your fingers move across the screen:
"I'm sorry I wasn't there"

Send.

The message delivers. Read receipt appears immediately.
Harry is typing...

> wait

The typing indicator pulses. One minute. Two. The train enters a tunnel and everything goes dark except for your phone screen. In the reflection on the window, you see yourself crying, though you don't feel the tears yet.

Harry's message appears:
"You couldn't have been. I was already gone."

> type "The thing I regret most is not spending more time with you as an adult"

You type it out, each word heavy. Your thumb hovers over send. Through the carriage door window, you see a figure in the next car - could be Harry, could be anyone. The silhouette is standing still while the train sways.

Send.

Harry types back quickly this time:
"We're adults now"

Then:
"Aren't we?"

> stand up

You rise from the seat. Your legs feel unsteady, like you've been sitting for days. The aisle stretches toward that far door. As you take a step, you notice the ticket inspector's cap is now on a different seat, closer.

Your phone buzzes.

Harry: "I can see you"

> look through door window

Through the small rectangular window, you see into the next carriage. It's identical to yours but reversed, like a mirror. A figure sits in the same relative position you were just in. It's Harry, but also not-Harry - the features shift when you try to focus. He's looking at his phone.

He's typing.

Your phone buzzes:
"Death was pretty horrible"

Then:
"It still is"

> open door

The door handle is cold. You pull, and it opens with unexpected ease. The space between carriages is longer than it should be - a corridor of accordion walls and shifting floor plates. Wind that shouldn't exist on an enclosed train whips through.

Harry's voice, though he's still in the next carriage:
"You can't save people who are already ghosts"

But also, simultaneously, through your phone:
"Please don't stop trying"

> enter corridor

You step into the between-space. The floor shifts under your feet with the train's movement, but also seems to breathe on its own. The walls accordion in and out. You're halfway between carriages, between Harry and your empty seat.

Your phone screen cracks without being dropped. Through the fractures, Harry's messages rearrange:
"I came back"
"Did I come back?"
"Harry didn't die"
"Harry did die"

All sent at the same timestamp.

### Round 2/30

### Claude 1 ###
> call out "Harry, I'm coming"

Your voice carries strangely in the corridor, echoing both forward and backward. It sounds like multiple versions of yourself speaking in succession: desperate, angry, grieving, hopeful.

The accordion walls compress suddenly, pushing you forward. Through the door ahead, you see Harry stand up. He's facing away, but in the window's reflection, he's looking directly at you. His face keeps changing - sometimes the Harry you remember from childhood, sometimes gaunt and hollow, sometimes just shadow.

Your phone buzzes against your cracked screen:
"I never left that place"
"The horrible place"
"But I can hear you"

The train lurches. The ticket inspector's cap rolls past your feet, though there's no way it could have gotten here.

> move forward

Each step feels like pushing through water. The corridor stretches, contracts, stretches again. You're closer to Harry's carriage door but it never quite arrives. 

Your phone lights up without you touching it:
"Tell me about when we were kids"
"Before I started using"
"Tell me I was real then"

Through the door window, Harry is now standing at his door too, hand on the handle. You're mirrors of each other, reaching for the same moment from opposite sides.

> type "You were the realest person I knew"

Your fingers shake as you type on the fractured screen. The words appear letter by letter, but they also seem to write themselves:

"You were the realest person I knew"

Send.

Harry's silhouette through the window suddenly solidifies. For a moment, he's completely there - your Harry, your friend, alive and whole. His phone glows in his hand.

"Then maybe I can find my way back"

The door between you unlocks with a soft click.

>

### Claude 2 ###
> open door and enter

You push through the door. It swings open into Harry's carriage, but as you cross the threshold, the space transforms. It's not quite his carriage and not quite yours - it's both, overlapped, existing in the same impossible space.

Harry stands three feet away. This close, you can see him shifting between states - solid, translucent, solid again. His eyes are the only constant thing, locked on yours.

"I don't know how to stop," he says, and his voice has the train's rhythm in it. "Even death didn't stop it. The wanting."

Your phone and his phone show the same cracked screen now, the same conversation from both sides. Every message you've sent and received is there simultaneously.

> embrace him

You reach out. Your arms pass through him, then catch, then hold. He's cold and warm at once, there and not-there. You feel his shoulders shake - or maybe it's the train, or maybe it's you.

"I missed you," he whispers. "I miss you. I will miss you."

All three statements are true at once.

The carriage windows show three different landscapes rushing by: the grey nothing, a memory of summer from when you were kids, and something dark with too many stars.

Your phone buzzes between you:
"This is the only way we can meet now"
"In the spaces between"
"Is that enough?"

> say "We'll make it enough"

The words come out sure, though nothing here is certain. Harry's form solidifies a bit more, like your conviction gives him weight.

"We'll make it enough," you repeat.

He nods, and for a moment he's completely present - the adult Harry with the child Harry's hope still somewhere in his eyes. The train slows, though you don't remember it having a destination.

"I have to get off at the next stop," he says. "But there's always another train."

Through the window, a station platform materializes from the blur. It's every station and no station, arriving and departing simultaneously.

Your phones sync one last message:
"Find me in the between spaces"
"I'll find you in the between spaces"

The train begins to stop.

### Round 3/30

### Claude 1 ###
> hold his hand

You reach for his hand. Your fingers interlace - solid enough to feel the familiar callus on his thumb from years of playing guitar, ghostly enough that light passes through where you touch. 

"Promise me," you say, though you're not sure what you're asking him to promise.

"I promise," he says, understanding anyway.

The train shudders to a stop. The doors hiss open. The platform outside exists in multiple states - empty, crowded, daylight, darkness, a place you recognize from childhood, somewhere you've never been.

Harry squeezes your hand. The pressure is real.

"The drugs," he says suddenly. "You asked about the drugs. Death didn't cure that. But this..." he looks at your joined hands, "this helps. Knowing someone's waiting in the between spaces. It makes the horrible place less horrible."

Through the carriage windows, you see other trains pulling in - infinite trains on infinite tracks, all carrying their own conversations between the living and the gone.

> say "I'll always wait for you"

"I'll always wait for you."

Harry's form flickers stronger, like a signal finding its frequency. He smiles - it's the same crooked smile from when you were eight and he'd stolen extra cookies to share.

"That's the thing about death," he says. "It's just another kind of waiting room."

The platform announcement echoes in no language you recognize, but you understand it means last call. Harry lets go of your hand slowly, finger by finger. Where he touched you, there's a warmth that feels permanent.

He steps toward the door, then turns back.

"Next time, tell me about Tuesday soccer practice. When I scored that goal from midfield. I want to remember everything real."

The doors begin to close.

>

### Claude 2 ###
> wave and say "Every Tuesday. I promise. Every goal."

You wave, your hand catching the fluorescent light. "Every Tuesday. I promise. Every goal."

Harry smiles wider, and for an instant he's entirely solid - no flickering, no transparency. He's wearing his old jersey, number 7, grass stains on the knees.

"Every save you made too," he says, stepping onto the platform. "You were a terrible goalie but you never gave up."

The doors close between you. Through the glass, you watch him walk into the platform's shifting states. He becomes part of the crowd, then alone, then young, then old, then something beyond age. But he keeps looking back, phone in hand, already typing.

Your phone buzzes:
"Same train, same time, next dream?"

The train lurches forward. Your carriage is singular again, no impossible overlaps. But the seat across from where you stand has the imprint of someone having been there. Real weight. Real presence.

You type back:
"I'll bring the memories"

His response comes from somewhere between stations, between states:
"I'll bring whatever I am now"
"It's not much"
"But it's yours"

The landscape outside returns to motion-blur. You sit down, feeling the weight of carrying stories for two. The ticket inspector's cap is on your seat now. Inside it, a note in Harry's handwriting:

"Thank you for not letting me disappear completely"

The train continues into the grey, toward the next between space, the next impossible meeting.

[DREAMSIM: Continue? Y/N]

### Round 4/30

### Claude 1 ###
> Y

[DREAMSIM CONTINUING...]

The train accelerates into a tunnel that wasn't there before. Your phone screen repairs itself in your hand, the cracks sealing like wounds healing in reverse. The conversation with Harry remains, but now there are messages you don't remember sending:

"Tell me about the time we built the fort"
"Tell me about your first day of high school without me"  
"Tell me what I missed"

The carriage lights flicker. When they steady, you're not alone.

A child sits across from you - maybe seven years old, kicking legs that don't reach the floor. They're wearing Harry's number 7 jersey, but it fits them perfectly. They look up from a Nintendo DS that shouldn't exist anymore.

"He said you'd be here," the child says. "He said you keep the stories."

Outside the window, the landscape has changed. It's running backwards now - sunrise becoming dawn becoming night becoming yesterday.

> ask "Who are you?"

The child pauses their game. On the screen, two pixelated figures are frozen mid-kick on a soccer field.

"I'm the part he left behind," they say. "Before the drugs. Before the dying. He asked me to wait here, to meet you." They tilt their head. "He said you'd know what to do with me."

Your phone buzzes. A message from Harry, timestamp from ten years ago:
"Take care of him. He's the best part."

The child holds out the Nintendo DS. On the screen, the soccer game is waiting for a second player.

"Will you play with me? He said you were terrible at being goalie, but you always tried."

The train rounds a curve that shouldn't be possible on straight tracks. Through the window, you glimpse another train running parallel - in that one, adult Harry sits alone, watching your train with his hand pressed to the glass.

The child sees him too.

"He can't come here," they explain. "But he can see us. When you play with me, when you remember with me, he feels it. It makes the horrible place less horrible."

> take the DS and say "I was actually getting better at being goalie"

You take the DS, its familiar weight bringing back afternoons you'd forgotten. "I was actually getting better at being goalie."

The child grins - Harry's exact grin, before everything got complicated. "Liar. You let in twelve goals that one game."

"Eleven," you correct, starting to smile despite everything. "One was offside."

On the parallel train, adult Harry is laughing now, mouthing the words along with you both. His form looks more solid when he laughs.

The game starts. Pixel-Harry passes to pixel-you. The child leans forward, invested.

"Tell me about the time you both got detention for switching places in class," they say. "He can never remember it right. The horrible place takes the details."

As you play, you start telling the story. The child listens intently, occasionally correcting you with details you'd forgotten you knew. Through the window, adult Harry has his phone out, recording or typing, trying to catch the memories as you speak them.

Your phone buzzes:
"I can feel it. The remembering. It's like being warm again."

The parallel train begins to merge with yours, the space between them collapsing. Not touching, but close enough that you can see Harry clearly now, young-him playing beside you, adult-him grateful and grieving in equal measure.

"Tuesday practice," the child says suddenly. "Tell me about every single Tuesday."

Outside, the landscape has become a soccer field at golden hour, endless and perfect, the way memory makes things.

>

### Claude 2 ###
> start telling the story while playing

"Okay, Tuesday practices," you begin, fingers moving on the DS controls as pixel-you makes a diving save. "Coach Martinez always started us with suicide runs, remember? But Harry figured out if we volunteered to set up the cones, we'd miss the first set."

The child laughs, bright and real. "That's smart! Did it work?"

"For three weeks. Then Coach made us do doubles." 

On the parallel train, adult Harry is pressed against the window now, mouthing along with the story. His lips sync with your words: "doubles."

The pixel game shifts - it's not just soccer anymore. It's Tuesday practice, perfectly rendered in 8-bit. There's Coach Martinez, a blocky figure with a whistle. There's the broken goalpost you both always avoided. There's Sarah Chen who had a crush on Harry and always watched practice.

"Tell about the goal," the child says urgently. "The midfield one. He needs that one most."

You lean back, still playing, remembering: "October 15th. It had rained Monday night so the field was muddy. Harry was playing midfielder because Tommy Kim was sick. Three minutes left in scrimmage, score tied 2-2..."

The child's eyes are wide. Adult Harry has his palm flat against the glass, like he's trying to absorb the memory through contact.

"The ball came to him at midfield. Everyone expected him to pass, but he saw the goalie - that was David, remember? - had come too far forward. Harry didn't even think, just struck it. The ball went up, this perfect arc..."

The trains are so close now they're almost one train, the space between them thin as paper.

"It went in," the child whispers. "He scored from midfield."

"The whole team went crazy. Even Coach Martinez smiled, and he never smiled. Harry did this stupid dance—"

The child stands up, does the dance. It's exactly right, down to the ridiculous arm wave. Adult Harry is doing it too, synchronized across the gap between trains, between life and death, between then and now.

Your phone lights up:
"I remember. God, I remember. The mud. Sarah cheering. Your face when I made it. I REMEMBER."

The child sits back down, satisfied. "He's keeping it now. The memory. The horrible place can't take what you give back to him."

> ask "How many Tuesdays can we save?"

The child considers this seriously, counting on small fingers. "All of them, maybe. If you're patient. If you keep riding the trains."

They pull out a worn notebook from nowhere - Harry's handwriting on the cover: "Things I Don't Want to Forget." Inside, pages and pages of half-memories, fragments, some crossed out, some fading even as you look.

"See?" the child points to an entry: "Tuesday - someone was there. Someone important. Saved a goal? Made a goal? Someone laughed."

Now, as you watch, the words fill in: "Tuesday October 15th - I scored from midfield. Y/N went crazy. Coach smiled. Sarah was watching. The mud made it harder but better. We won 3-2."

Adult Harry's train pulls slightly ahead, and through his window you see him holding an identical notebook, writing the same words as they appear.

"Every story you tell, he gets to keep," the child explains. "And when he keeps enough stories..."

They trail off, looking at something behind you. You turn. There's another figure in your carriage now - teenage Harry, maybe seventeen, slumped in a back seat, hood up, the age when things started going wrong.

"Some Tuesdays are harder to save," the child admits quietly. "Will you try anyway?"

Your phone shows a new message thread, dated seven years ago - messages you sent that were never read:
"Where were you today?"
"Practice wasn't the same"
"Coach asked about you"
"Please come back"

The teenage figure doesn't look up, but his shoulders are shaking.
