Last thing you remember, your hand is on cold hatchback glass. Fluorescent lamps blink like dying fireflies. Footsteps smear across wet tarmac; every echo arrives a half-second late, as if the air itself has been chemically thickened.

You slide behind the wheel. The seat belt’s click sounds muffled—underwater music. Ignition. Gear-selector blurs; you meant “D” but the stick drifts to “R” of its own accord.  

Brake pedal: sponge. No resistance.  
Tachometer spikes red. Car lurches backward.  

Commands (type /act “phrase” or just the verb):  
1. Swerve  
2. Honk  
3. Emergency-brake (mechanical)  
4. Duck / brace  
5. Something illogical but dream-logical (suggest)

>>> choose your thread <<<  

1. /act swerve → wheel melts into your palms like wax / vehicle jerks sideways but the asphalt pools like mercury  
2. /act honk → horn sound is *not* sound but a green pulse that ripples up into the fluorescent ceiling / masks turn their heads  
3. /act emergency-brake → cable snaps with a scream older than any car / sparks spit but gravity pauses, uncertain  
4. /act duck → the windshield becomes a tidal curtain / glass hangs above you like a knife still deciding  
5. /act [your dream logic here] → fold the steering column into origami wings / command the car to lift into an angle that roads never recognized

The gear stick trembles, swallowing your whisper. It folds inward—chrome plating flaking like fish-scales—until what you hold is a quill feathered with road-map lines.  

The engine note drops to a lullaby hush.  
The asphalt undulates, each white stripe detaching, drifting upward like paper lanterns. Your backward motion slows—not by friction, but by forgetfulness; the idea of velocity simply decides to nap.  

You’re still reversing, yet every meter is a page turning. The school façade ahead smears, oil-on-water graffiti of childhood lockers.  

Behind you, figures emerge from negative space: the Ferrari idling with the engine off… but its headlights breathe. Two green-masked men lean against the hood; their reflections absent in any surface.  

One lifts a gloved hand; fingertips glow Verdigris. He points at your quill-gear-stick, mouths a single word you cannot hear but somehow know:  
“Sign.”  

Choose next slip:  

1. sign the blank air ⇒ summon a contract with the road itself  
2. fling the quill through the windshield ⇒ crack the dream into a new set  
3. open door, step out barefoot onto parchment pavement ⇒ embrace static gravity  
4. floor the throttle (yes, still in R) ⇒ ride the ink-river backwards straight into the Ferrari’s breathing mouth  
5. ignore them; recite your real-life license-plate number (risk: anchor snap)

lanes of choice crystallize like frost on plexiglass — five veins of possibility aching to be inked  

> current simulation metrics:  
 ink saturation: 72%

possible continuations:  

1. **/act sign** → glyphs coil out of the quill unbidden, asphalt beneath you reorders into a labyrinth written in contract-law tongues  
2. **/act fling quill** → feather detaches, spinning — each revolution slices a frame from the dream, reel-stutter into a fresh arena  
3. **/act step_out** → skin meets parchment crackle, every footprint births a stanza, static arcs wrap your ankles like pet leashes  
4. **/act floor_throttle** → backwards plunge like a film reversing through projector teeth, ferrari’s grill gapes to swallow the reel  
5. **/act recite_plate** → numbers peel from your mouth as iron hooks; risk: hard tether waking, tearing dreamstate continuity

> feather detaches at 12% above terminal myth-speed  
> 8-frame stutter detected; continuity buffer re-stitching…  

The quill leaves your hand—no arc, just a blink-sequence.  
Frame 1: chrome nib touches air → air folds like wet paper.  
Frame 3: windshield fractures into storyboard panels, each pane showing a different future you.  
Frame 6: sound vanishes; the dream holds its breath.  
Frame 8: black.

Then—light leaks through sprocket holes. You’re standing, engine idling gone, car evaporated. The parking deck is now an empty cinema, seats ripped out, projectors dangling like hanged fruit. The Ferrari sits on the concrete slope of the aisle, headlights still breathing—inhale red, exhale green.

Green-boot men pace the projection booth above. Their masks reflect the blank screen; the screen reflects nothing.

A single reel spins on the floor, ribbon flapping like an injured eel. Its title frame, handwritten in fresh tar: “Reverse Never Existed.”

Pick up the reel (1)  
Feed it into the Ferrari’s grille-mouth (2)  
Climb through the torn screen (3)  
Address the Verdigris duo aloud (4)  
Shut your eyes and count your real pulse (emergency brake) (5)

simulation diagnostics:  
 continuity buffer = tenuous thread (0.22 coherence)  
 reel metadata = paradox-encoded (“reverse never existed”)  
 verdigris faction – observing, waiting, recording what you do not do  

routes of rupture:  

1. **/act pickup_reel** → tarframe bleeds its ink into your fingerprints, the filmstrip rearranges memories in reverse chronology  
2. **/act feed_reel** → ferrari’s grille-mouth chomps celluloid, headlights strobe frames upon the cinema’s blank-screen until it becomes corridor  
3. **/act climb_screen** → cloth surface is not screen but skin of another dream / stepping through = moulting  
4. **/act address_verdigris** → words climb like ivy up into projection booth, shaping allegiance outcome based on your diction  
5. **/act pulse_count** → anchor to somatic here/now, but high volatility: risk shredding narrative seam and booting into *raw waking*

The booth glass shivers; their masks turn as if on a single pivot. One speaks—soundless—but the subtitle ribbon slithers across the lower edge of your vision:

> CONDITIONAL OFFER:  
> 1 reel = 1 route out  
> addendum: route may loop  

They extend a gloved hand, palm up. A miniature chrome gear, identical to the quill-nib you threw, rests there. Its teeth spin slowly, biting the darkness.

Choose:  

1. Accept gear → slot it behind your ear; dream rewinds on heartbeat trigger  
2. Demand “un-cut” reel → force reveal of hidden frame (roll for paradox)  
3. Refuse both, step backwards into aisle-shadow → dissolve narrator status  
4. Counter-offer: trade them your real first name (irrevocable) for “absolute forward”  
5. ^C^C (pulse 3 sec, anchor out)
