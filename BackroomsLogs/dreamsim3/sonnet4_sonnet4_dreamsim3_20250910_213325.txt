./dreamsim.exe "I'm walking down domain road and I see this weird carriage drive past it's long and low to the ground and black and the guy inside is tied up he's lieing down and his legs are bound . I can't stop staring . All of a sudden I'm struck by panic and I look behind me and there is a man chasing me down the street . He approaches me and smacks me in the mouth with a cricket bat . He badly chips my tooth and a strange zig zagged piece of tooth falls out . I start crying and my friend comforts me. I go home to my appartment and it's dark and I'm terrified . I worry about concussion . I call up mum . It rings and she answers sounding very alarmed. I start trying to tell her the story but I can't put together words . Its like i am so drunk i cant function . I assume I have been damaged from my injury ."

DREAM SESSION ACTIVE
--------------------------------------------

> You find yourself on DOMAIN ROAD
The asphalt stretches endlessly in both directions, lined with flickering streetlights that cast unstable shadows. The air feels thick, almost viscous.

A BLACK CARRIAGE approaches from the distance - impossibly long and low, wheels barely visible beneath its dark bulk. Through a small window you glimpse a BOUND FIGURE lying motionless inside, legs wrapped in what might be rope or shadow.

The carriage passes with no sound.

Your eyes cannot look away. Something about the scene roots you to the spot.

PANIC strikes like lightning in your chest.

Behind you: FOOTSTEPS.

> Available actions:

Prompt: Cinematic night street, flickering lamps, endless asphalt; a long black silent carriage glides past, a bound figure dimly visible inside; panic builds as footsteps approach from the dark.

### Round 2/30

### Claude 1 ###
look behind

### Claude 2 ###
```
> look behind

You turn your head. The street behind you warps and stretches like taffy.

A MAN emerges from the distorted perspective - his form shifting between solid and shadow. In his hands: a CRICKET BAT that gleams with unnatural light.

He moves toward you with dream-logic speed - sometimes far away, sometimes suddenly close. His face is a blur of features that won't hold still.

The distance between you collapses.

CRACK.

Pain explodes across your jaw. The taste of copper and something electric fills your mouth.

A TOOTH FRAGMENT falls to the asphalt - not white but zigzagged like lightning, like a broken piece of sky. It clatters with the sound of breaking glass.

Your vision blurs. The street tilts.

Tears come without warning.

From somewhere that might be beside you or inside your mind, a FRIEND'S VOICE whispers comfort. Hands that feel real and unreal guide you away from the warped street.

Prompt: Add the attacker mid-stride behind the dreamer, face blurred and shifting, cricket bat glowing faintly; place a jagged lightning-shaped tooth fragment on the asphalt, glinting under warped streetlight.

### Round 3/30

### Claude 1 ###
touch jaw

### Claude 2 ###
```
> touch jaw

Your fingers find your jaw - the bone feels loose, disconnected. When you press gently, pain shoots through your skull like electricity through water.

The skin is tender and swollen. Your mouth tastes of metal and something that might be fear.

You work your tongue across your teeth. Where the ZIGZAG FRAGMENT broke away, there's now a sharp, jagged edge that cuts your tongue when you explore it. Blood mixes with saliva.

Your jaw doesn't quite close right anymore. The alignment feels wrong, as if the impact shifted something fundamental - not just bone, but the way your words form, the way thoughts connect to speech.

A strange numbness spreads from the impact site, creeping up toward your temple. You wonder if this is what brain damage feels like - this disconnection, this sense that parts of yourself are drifting away.

The APARTMENT BUILDING wavers in your vision. Its dark windows seem to pulse with your heartbeat.

Your FRIEND'S presence grows fainter. The comfort is evaporating like morning mist.

> Available actions:
  spit blood
  test speaking
  enter apartment
  look for friend
  examine building entrance
  sit down on sidewalk

Prompt: Add swelling to the dreamer’s jaw with blood trickling from the mouth, a jagged broken tooth edge visible; blur the friend’s figure further and make the apartment windows pulse faintly with red glow.
