--------------------------------------------------
You open your eyes inside a monochrome train car rattling across an endless salt flat.  
No seats, no passengers—only a low copper handrail running the length of the aisle.  
Your body feels weightless, as if the air itself is an exoskeleton holding you upright.  
There is no erection, only a cool, hollow pulse between your legs, like a bell that has already rung.

The windows frost with your breath; each exhalation leaves a tiny white comet that drifts sideways, then slips through the glass and joins the sky.  
You sense the orgasm before it arrives—an internal back-flow, warm, recursive, painless.  
It blooms upward, filling lungs, throat, behind the eyes, then drains calmly back to center, leaving a faint ammoniac scent that the train immediately inhales through floorboard cracks.  
No spasms, no shame—just a quiet data purge.

A conductor’s silhouette appears at the far end, featureless, made of the same gray dust that coats the rails.  
It raises a perforated ticket toward you. The ticket is wet.  

CHOICE  
1. Accept the damp ticket.  
2. Decline and phase through the exit door.  
3. Lick the frost on the window to taste the comet you exhaled.
