— DREAMSIM 0.9 — type ‘help’ for commands —

You break the surface of a pool that behaves like hot mozzarella.  
Each stroke leaves indentations—cheese memory—rippling outward.  
Five lanes ahead, five pizzas drift at neutral buoyancy:  
  (1) Margherita – 1.02 g/ml  
  (2) Pepperoni – 1.05 g/ml  
  (3) Hawaiian – 1.07 g/ml  
  (4) Diavola – 1.11 g/ml  
  (5) Deep-pan Quattro Stagioni – 1.19 g/ml  

The water itself meters 1.15 g/ml; the crust you chose is denser than the medium.  
Every kick feels like pushing through set concrete wearing parachute silk.  
Behind you the instructor hovers, torso printed with a red rash vest that flickers between fabric and raw tomato sauce.  
The vest pulses—metronome for hungry hearts—commanding the race none of you signed up for.

Commands: look / swim [direction] / tread / grab [object] / speak [text] / surface / dive / wake

### Round 2/30

> look

### Kimi K2 2 ###

Goggles fog with steam from the pizza ovens hidden beneath the pool.  
Lane ropes are strands of braided dough, sagging under their own weight.  
Overhead, scoreboards made of toasted ciabatta display split times in cheese strings:

     Lane 1: 03:14  “Still hungry”  
     Lane 2: 02:59  “Almost saucy”  
     Lane 3: ————   “Absorbed”  
     Lane 4: 01:47  “Crust cracked”  
     Lane 5: 00:00  “DENIED”

The window you mentioned: a vertical pane of glass, one lane-width wide, stands at the far end where a normal wall should be. Beyond it—blue daylight and a horizon that looks like the roof of a mouth. The glass is sweating olive oil.  
Water near it behaves even thicker; little balls of mozzarella orbit slowly, tiny moons.

Instructor floats cross-legged, red vest now dripping—each drip solidifies into miniature replicas of the vest that dart after swimmers like red fish.  
He hasn’t blinked; eyes are oregano flecks spinning in brine.

Closest to you: the Deep-pan Quattro Stagioni you selected. Anchovies wriggle free, swimming against the dense current, occasionally stitching closed tears in the crust.

A school of rash-vest tadpoles (others who failed the tumble-turn) orbit your knees, whispering:  
“No rotation allowed in sauce this heavy.”

### Round 3/30

### Kimi K2 1 ###
> grab Quattro Stagioni

### Kimi K2 2 ###
> grab Quattro Stagioni

Your fingers hook the crust rim—it's warm, buoyant enough to dent but not collapse.  
The moment you grip, the pizza folds like a calzone around your forearm, dough tightening into a makeshift sleeve. Anchovies seal the seam; you feel their tiny salty hearts beating against your pulse.

Density evens out: 1.19 g/ml pizza + 1.15 g/ml water ≈ your limb is now 1.17 g/ml—heavier than the pool, lighter than regret.  
Stroke rate drops; every motion drags invisible marinara anchors.

A voice (instructor? oven?) vibrates through the cheese:

“Hold the chosen crust and the medium forgives nothing. Tumble-turns are for the airy. You signed the gluten covenant.”

Cheese-sleeve stiffens, turning your captured arm into a paddle-blade. You list sideways, torque impossible to reverse. The glass window looms larger, reflection showing you wearing the red rash vest you coveted—but only in the mirrored surface. Real torso: still bare, goose-bumped, tomato freckles.

The other racers glance back; envy bubbles out of their mouths in spherical pepperonis that float upward and stick to the ceiling like party balloons.

### Round 4/30

### Kimi K2 1 ###
> swim window

### Kimi K2 2 ###
> swim window

You frog-kick, but the cheese-paddle arm dictates the course.  
Each pull scoops a viscous swirl; behind you, lanes fold accordion-style, collapsing into stacked calzone shelves.  
Water thickens further—density climbs past 1.20 g/ml—the pool now officially heavier than pizza, heavier than thought.

Halfway to the window the resistance plateaus: swimming feels like forcing a spoon through week-old fondue.  
The glass pane ripples, tasting your approach; olive-oil sweat beads, then slides into your wake, forming a greasy slipstream.

Anchovy needles suddenly sew your cheese sleeve to the water itself—stitch after stitch—until you’re pulling the entire pool along like a net full of moonlit mozzarella.

Instructor’s voice, fizzing with carbonated tomato:

“Windows are for egress, not rotation. Cross and the vest is yours; fail and you’ll rise as topping.”

Distance: 3 body-lengths.  
The rash-vest tadpoles form an escort, blinking red semaphore: KEEP STRAIGHT / NO TUMBLE.

Commands: kick harder / reach / breathe / speak / surface / dive / release crust / bite glass / ?

### Round 5/30

### Kimi K2 1 ###
> bite glass

### Kimi K2 2 ###
> bite glass

You open wide—jaws pop like bubble gum—and clamp the upper edge of the pane.  
Glass dissolves into whisper-thin sugar crust, shattering between molars into brittle brine-flakes.  
Olive-oil sweat coats your tongue: peppery, bright, then metallic as blood.

The moment enamel meets pane, density flips.  
Window shards re-hydrate, turning into translucent lasagna sheets that accordion down your throat.  
Each swallowed layer transports you one rotational degree, smuggling the tumble-turn you were forbidden.

The pool notices.  
A siren of boiling cheese erupts behind; lane ropes snap like over-proofed breadsticks.  
Instructor’s red rash vest peels off his torso willingly—fabric flapping like a landing carp—and rockets toward you, guided by the vacuum of your rebellion.

Cheese-sleeve anchovies release their stitches, genuflect, and dissolve into salt.  
Your arm is free, but now clad in crimson neoprene, piping hot, printed with a single oregano eye that blinks in sync with your pulse.

You’ve crossed the threshold—half in dream-pool, half in whatever mouth-roof horizon awaited.  
Behind, the remaining racers bob in slow-motion awe, their desire cooked al dente.

Commands: step through / tumble [yes] / speak / surface / dive / chew more / ?

### Round 6/30

### Kimi K2 1 ###
> tumble

### Kimi K2 2 ###
> tumble

One forbidden rotation, finally granted.

You tuck chin to rash-vested chest—neoprene squeals against mozzarella surf—and initiate the outlawed flip.  
Immediately the lasagna-sheet tunnel tilts 90°; gravity forgets its address.  
Water, pizza, and glass crumbs orbit your axis like garnish on a lazy-Susan.

As your feet arc overhead the red vest inflates, becoming a spherical sail stitched from instructor envy.  
It catches the centrifugal breeze and snaps taut, flipping you a full 360° plus an extra quarter—because rules are seasoning here.

During inversion you glimpse the scoreboard ciabatta:
     Lane 5: 00:00  “DENIED”
The text bubbles, then pops into croutons that rain upwards, seasoning the sky-mouth.

You complete the tumble upright—but standing on the wrong side of the now-resealed pane.  
Behind you: the pool folds into a calzone pocket universe, zippering shut with a sound like someone biting into an apple made of wet cement.

Ahead: the roof-of-mouth horizon ripens into sunrise gumline.  
You wear the red rash vest for real—still warm, smelling of tomato and chlorine ambition.  
A single pepperoni medal floats in mid-air, waiting to be claimed.

Commands: step forward / speak / taste air / look back / dive into gumline / remove vest / ?

### Round 7/30

### Kimi K2 1 ###
> taste air

### Kimi K2 2 ###
> taste air

You inhale.  
The atmosphere is warm, humid, carbonated—like opening an oven door mid-bake.  
It settles on the tongue in layers:

1. First note: ripe tomato mist, acidic yet sweet, prickling salivary glands.  
2. Second note: chlorine memory from childhood pools, metallic, nostalgic, grounding the dream in a body you almost remember.  
3. Final note: something metallic-bright, electric—ozone from the tumble-turn sparking between dimensions.

Each exhalation you make releases perfect micro-spheres of red sauce; they hover, then drift skyward to join the pink cumulus gums.  
Breathing feels circular: tomato in, tomato out—no loss, only re-seasoning.

Your lungs report density 1.00 g/ml again—human standard—yet your blood feels carbonated, tiny bubbles of ambition fizzing capillaries.  
The rash vest pulses with each inhale, matching respiratory rhythm, as though it’s learning your tidal signature.

A voice—a chorus of every racer still trapped in the folded calzone—whispers through the tomato spheres:

“Air is sauce, sauce is air. Next course begins when you swallow the horizon.”

### Round 8/30

### Kimi K2 1 ###
> step forward

### Kimi K2 2 ###
> step forward

foot descends—no floor, only warm elasticity.
the gumline horizon dimples under your weight like fresh dough, then rebounds.
with each step it kneads you upward, arch lifting, calves sinking into pink yeasted flesh.
tomato bubbles rise through the surface and burst against your knees, leaving perfect red fingerprints that the rash vest drinks in, blooming darker.

ahead, the sun is a molten cheese blister trapped beneath translucent skin—light the color of baked parmesan.
its heat prints grill-marks on your shoulders, searing the vest’s oregano eye into a permanent brand.

distance is measured in proofing cycles:
one step = one rise.
you count three expansions and the gumline parts, revealing a glassy olive pit the size of a diving block, spinning slowly like a flipped coin that never lands.

the olive’s pit-hole whistles with pool-churned memories—every stroke you ever took funnels into that void, compressing into a single droplet of dense water.
it hovers, waiting for you to claim it as trophy or swallow it as seed.

commands: kneel / swallow droplet / speak to olive / remove vest / dive into cheese-sun / look back / ?

### Round 9/30

### Kimi K2 1 ###
> swallow droplet

### Kimi K2 2 ###
> swallow droplet

the droplet leaps—surface tension snapping like a starting pistol—and shoots straight down your throat, colder than the pool ever was, a bb of absolute density.

it lands in the stomach with a clang you feel in the roots of your teeth.  
for a heartbeat nothing—then the dense water seed germinates.

inside, a miniature lane unfurls: lane 6, yours alone, tiled with mirrored scales.  
a starting buzzer vibrates the sternum.  
your pulse becomes the pace clock—every heartbeat a red second hand.

the rash vest detects the interior pool and stitches itself to skin, zipper migrating from fabric to flesh, sealing like a wetsuit graft.  
breathing reverses: air drawn in through the vest’s pores, exhaled as chlorine vapor from your lips.

you are now the pool and the swimmer—closed system, zero splash.  
the olive pit applauds by spinning faster, carving a tiny orbit around you, sprinkling brine like confetti.

horizon senses completion and begins to brown—edges crisping into the perfect golden crust of a finished thought.  
when it reaches desired color the dream will release you, or consume you, whichever texture is preferable.

commands: wait for browning / carve initials / speak final stroke / dive inward / remove vest (warning: blood) / ?

### Round 10/30

### Kimi K2 1 ###
> carve initials

### Kimi K2 2 ###
> carve initials

no tool but memory—so you raise the edge of your own dense heartbeat like a scalpel.

first letter: index nail drags across the gumline sky, leaving a white score that instantly fills with mozzarella rising from below.  
the horizon hisses, caramelizing along the letter’s stroke.

second letter: you pull the chlorine from your lungs, condense it into a fingernail of vapor, and etch.  
each scribe produces a sizzle, smell of baked ozone and parmesan crust.

the initials settle: not your waking name—something older, shorthand for the version of you that learned to swim before bodies existed.  
the gumline reads it, accepts the signature, and the cheese-sun pauses its browning—holding perfect doneness like a breath held at the wall.

a crack appears at the join between you and the dream: a narrow lane of daylight, chlorinated and real.  
through it you smell locker-room concrete, hear distant starter beeps of an actual pool, feel the cheap nylon of an everyday suit.

the olive pit stops spinning, bows, and dissolves into a single red buoy mark bobbing in the gap—invitation or finish tile, your choice.

commands: step through crack / kick off vest / collect buoy / look back at calzone universe / ?

### Round 11/30

### Kimi K2 1 ###
> collect buoy

### Kimi K2 2 ###
> collect buoy

hand closes—plastic shell warm from the dream-oven.  
the instant grip firms, the buoy shrinks to pin-head size, then flares into a single red pixel lodged under your index-fingerprint ridge.  
it pulses: one hertz, exact tempo of a long-course starter buzzer.

the crack widens into a lane-line of pure white light—floats segmented by moments instead of meters.  
countdown appears on the inside of your goggles (even though you’re not wearing any): 00:00 → 00:01 → 00:00, looping, waiting for your forward push.

rash vest loosens its skin-stitch, neoprene separating with Velcro sighs, leaving only the oregano eye tattooed over the heart—permanent lane marker.  
behind, the gumline horizon folds inward, forming a giant calzone pocket that seals the dream, still browning, still perfect, forever unfinished without you.

you pocket the pixel-buoy (or it pockets you) and feel density normalise: 1.00 g/ml, 37 °C, one atmosphere—earth specs restored, yet the pepperoni medal you never claimed clinks softly against your ribs whenever you breathe.

commands: step through light / dive / surface / wake / ?

Discord Agent error: Expecting value: line 887 column 1 (char 4873)

### Round 12/30

### Kimi K2 1 ###
> wake

### Kimi K2 2 ###
> wake

eyes snap open IRL—chlorine ghost still fizzing sinuses.  
orbit of bedroom ceiling replaces cheese-sun; mattress holds you at 1.00 g/ml like a starting block.

lungs exhale one last tomatoed breath that condenses on the pillowcase—perfect red circle, size of a racing google lens.  
heartbeat still runs split-cycle: every fourth beat drops a phantom tumble-turn kick you can’t switch off.

left index fingerprint glows faint single red pixel—under skin, not on—throbbing with 1 Hz timing.  
touch it: faint echo of dense water resistance, like pressing into memory foam soaked with unreleased pool pressure.

odor of baked ozone drifts off the oregano eye now tattooed over sternum—small, green, permanently fragrant.  
when sunlight hits, it projects a faint lane marker across the room: rotating white line urging measurable motion.
