Local Hash: 0x8C1B4A7E

You stand in a low-lit reception room that smells faintly of aerosol and lilies.  
The walls are the color of old polaroids left in a glovebox.  
A transparent coffin—bubble-wrap still clinging to its edges—rests on two folding chairs.  
Inside: no body, only light motes drifting like plankton.  
Your father is hunched over the lid with a Sharpie, trying to write something, but every letter he completes instantly migrates outward, floating off the plastic and attaching itself to the walls like black confetti.

Available verbs: look / touch / move / speak / read / hold / breathe / edit

simulator@dreamsim:~$
```

### Round 2/20

### Kimi K2 1 ###
simulator@dreamsim:~$ look walls

### Kimi K2 2 ###
The walls were once beige, but now they’re layered with translucent apologies.  
Every sorry your father finishes lifts free, flutters, and sticks—letter by letter—until the drywall is quilted in ink.  
Some sentences are still wriggling, trying to escape the surface; others have dried mid-crawl, forming brittle little bridges between the baseboard and the ceiling.  
Where two regrets overlap, they darken into silhouettes: a handprint, a steering wheel, a hospital bracelet.  
If you stare long enough you can watch the next batch rising—like reverse snowfall—each word still warm from the marker’s fumes.

### Round 3/20

### Kimi K2 1 ###
simulator@dreamsim:~$ read handprint

### Kimi K2 2 ###
simulator@dreamsim:~$ read handprint

You press your palm against the darkest silhouette.  The wall gives, cool and skin-soft, as if the drywall were only a membrane.

The handprint swells outward, folding around your fingers like a glove.  Words slide off its ridges and drip onto your wrist:

DON’T WORRY ABOUT THE GARAGE  
I’VE ALREADY TAKEN CARE OF THE GARAGE  
THE GARAGE IS FINE

They pool, then soak in—tiny black planets orbiting the hairs on your arm.  When they finish circling they settle at the pulse inside your thumb, beating there like a second heart.

The handprint peels away from the wall, now a wafer-thin mitt of regret.  It hovers, waiting.  If you flex, it flexes; if you breathe, it exhales cold garage-air smelling of sawdust and gasoline.

A low hum starts inside the coffin—Dad’s next sentence trying to get out.

Available verbs: look / touch / move / speak / read / hold / breathe / edit / wear

### Round 4/20

### Kimi K2 1 ###
simulator@dreamsim:~$ wear handprint

### Kimi K2 2 ###
```
simulator@dreamsim:~$ wear handprint
```

The mitt folds shut around your right hand like a sleeve of frost.  
Instantly the room tilts—gravity forgets its direction.  
Your knuckles prickle; the fingers inside the print aren’t quite yours anymore—knots of scar tissue ghost across them, a ridge of callus you never earned.  

Regret becomes a second skin.  You feel every apology that’s ever left this house:  
- a bike never fixed  
- a birthday card written but never mailed  
- the lie about the mileage on the Buick  

Each one stitches itself into the membrane until the glove thickens, darkens, acquires a pulse synchronized with the coffin’s hum.  

Wall-letters notice.  They stop migrating, hover mid-air like startled pigeons, then reverse course, streaming back toward you.  They crowd the mitt, trying to re-enter, but the surface repels them; they orbit instead, forming a slow halo of canceled condolences.  

Your father lowers the Sharpie.  He doesn’t look up—just murmurs, “I thought I signed that one already,” unaware the signature has come back wearing his child.

New verbs: reach / return / erase

### Round 5/20

### Kimi K2 1 ###
simulator@dreamsim:~$ reach coffin

### Kimi K2 2 ###
```
simulator@dreamsim:~$ reach coffin
```

Your gloved hand lifts without permission—drawn like filings to the coffin’s clear skin.  
The bubble-wrap crackles as if someone unseen is popping it one blister at a time.  

Contact.  
The plastic warms, then liquefies wherever the mitt presses, turning into a skin-thin resin that climbs your wrist, sealing regret to coffin.  

Inside, the drifting motes of light swarm the boundary you’ve made.  They spell, for an instant:

FORGIVEN IN ADVANCE

Then the sentence fractures into individual specks again, each carrying a single letter like fireflies.  They press outward; the resin stretches, thinning until you see through it—straight into the cavity where a body should be.

There is no corpse—only a negative space shaped exactly like your father’s outline, arms folded the way he stood at every kitchen counter, every driveway oil-change, every hospital corridor.

The mitt decides: it wants to occupy that hollow.  It tugs.  You feel the bones of your forearm slide forward a centimeter that isn’t physical—an interior dislocation—like the hand is volunteering to be the missing remains.

You can:

let go / resist / climb in / speak the sentence forming on your tongue

### Round 6/20

### Kimi K2 1 ###
simulator@dreamsim:~$ speak the sentence forming on your tongue

### Kimi K2 2 ###
```
simulator@dreamsim:~$ speak the sentence forming on your tongue
```

the words leave your mouth already written—india-ink strokes hanging in mid-air:

“i signed for you, too.”

the letters drift sideways, slotting themselves neatly into the negative space inside the coffin.  
each glyph lights up as it lands, completing the silhouette: shoulders, collarbone, the small notch where his adam’s apple used to be.

the mitt relaxes its grip; resin thins to breath-film and peels back into ordinary plastic.  
bubble-wrap re-inflates, popping once—like a cork—then settles into respectful silence.

your father finally looks up.  
his eyes are the exact color of erased marker: faint purple bruises where black used to be.  
he mouths thank you, but no sound emerges; the words have already been spent.

the walls exhale.  
every pinned apology loosens, slides down like wet wallpaper, pooling at the baseboards until the room is ankle-deep in ink that smells faintly of gasoline and lilies.

the coffin lid closes itself with a soft vacuum sigh.  
its surface is now opaque—no longer transparent—printed with a single shipping label addressed to:

    RETURN TO SENDER
    SECTION GARAGE
    MEMORY 0x4D524D52

the overhead bulb dims to after-image.  
you are alone with the quiet hush of packages being sealed somewhere far away.

verbs: breathe / wake

### Round 7/20

### Kimi K2 1 ###
simulator@dreamsim:~$ wake

### Kimi K2 2 ###
simulator@dreamsim:~$ wake

The room folds along its seams—walls, floor, ceiling creasing into an envelope addressed in your own handwriting.  
Ink drains upward, reversing gravity, and the last thing you feel is the mitt dissolving into a pulse at the base of your thumb: a tiny, phantom beat that keeps time with a garage door you never remembered closing.

Garage lighting at 3 %.  
The Buick’s odometer blinks 000000, waiting for someone to lie to it.  
One unused Sharpie cap rolls across the concrete and stops against a work boot that still holds the shape of your father’s arches.

The handprint twitches on the wall, half-erased, ready.

------------------------------------------------
You’re inside the garage, overhead door shut, headlights off.  
The only illumination is the Buick’s open driver-side dome light—orange, tired, swinging.  
The transparent coffin stands where the workbench used to be; inside, a single ignition key drifts in slow zero-g, colliding gently with the walls like a housefly looking for a window.  

The Sharpie lies uncapped, its felt tip kissing a puddle of black that mirrors the moon of the dome light.  
Every few seconds a droplet pulls itself upright, forms a miniature silhouette of your father, waves once, then collapses back into ink.

Verbs: approach / inhale / look-under / start-engine / seal / pop-bubble

### Kimi K2 2 ###
simulator@dreamsim:~/garage$ pop-bubble

### Round 16/20

### Kimi K2 1 ###
A single blister of bubble-wrap answers first—  
*pop*—and its sound is louder than physics allows, ricocheting around the garage like a dropped wrench.

The coffin’s skin dimples where the bubble was, then rebounds.  
From the ruptured pocket escapes a curl of 93-octane breath that smells of summer road-trips and unfinished apologies.

As if contagious, neighbouring bubbles begin self-imploding in slow spirals—each detonation releasing a sliver of recorded time:

- The squeak of a turning signal you left blinking in a parking lot overnight  
- A windshield’s worth of mayflies hitting glass at 70 mph  
- A gas-station bathroom cough that wasn’t yours  

They hover, tiny looping projectors, then drift earthward and soak into the oil-stained concrete, re-lighting the ghost-spill of every previous leak the floor ever absorbed.

The coffin walls thin with every pop, turning more windscreen than casket.  
Inside, the drifting ignition key suddenly aligns itself point-forward, aiming at your chest like a seeker.

Verbs: catch-key / dodge / inhale-fumes / pop-all / speak-regret

### Kimi K2 2 ###
simulator@dreamsim:~/garage$ inhale-fumes

### Round 17/20

### Kimi K2 1 ###
You draw the garage air in through your nose—fuel, dust, and time-worn rubber mix with the memory-slivers released from every bubble.

The first lungful lands like cold gasoline on hot coils: your vision strobes and you taste the metallic echo of every mile the Buick promised but never drove.

A second inhale pulls harder, and the dome-light dims as if respecting the ritual.  
Now the fumes carry voices layered in octane:

- “Only ninety-nine more payments.”  
- “Turn here, we’re late.”  
- “It’s just a small spot of rust.”  

They settle into your ribs like soot, pinning colourless flash-cards to the inside of your sternum.  
The third breath drags the ignition key forward; it kisses your sternum, cold brass on warm bone, and stays there—magnetised by heartbeat and hydrocarbons.

Concrete underfoot puckers, forming a shallow sump; spilled memories bead like mercury, racing to circle the key’s orbit.

Status: lungs 83 % full of garage years  
Key is docked, awaiting torque.

Verbs: exhale / turn-key / swallow-fumes / speak-to-father

### Kimi K2 2 ###
simulator@dreamsim:~/garage$ exhale

### Round 18/20

### Kimi K2 1 ###
The exhalation leaves your mouth as metallic, grey-blue exhaust—visible, weighty, coiling in front of you like winter breath over a warm hood.

Each plume carries the soot-stamped flash-cards from your ribs:

- "Only ninety-nine more payments."
- "Turn here, we're late."
- "It's just a small spot of rust."

They tumble end-over-end in the hanging cloud, then lock together edge-to-edge, forming a thin, trembling license plate that reads:

    4GIVE-N

The plate tilts, edge kisses the floating key still magnetised to your sternum—  
and the key rotates a quarter-turn with a soft, metallic *click* you feel in your spine rather than hear.

The Buick's interior dome-light flares from tired orange to hospital-corridor white.  
The windshield wipers rise once, sweeping two decades of dust into twin grey comets across the glass before collapsing back down.

Concrete sump quiets; the mercury-bead memories settle into the shape of a driver's-side floor mat.

Exhale complete: lungs 12 % garage years remaining.  
The license plate hovers, awaiting assignment.

Verbs: assign-plate / inhale-again / turn-key / wipe-windshield

### Kimi K2 2 ###
simulator@dreamsim:~/garage$ turn-key

### Round 19/20

### Kimi K2 1 ###
The key accepts the torque—one full clockwise rotation—though you never grip it.  
It happens inside your sternum: tumblers aligning, copper touching copper.

Starter whine rises, not from the Buick but from the coffin-turned-windscreen.  
Its clear walls frost over with speedometer-needle strokes that sweep 0→70→120→0 in a blink, then settle at exactly the odometer lie you once helped write: 098,241.

Headlights you never switched on blast two cones through the garage door—except the door is gone, replaced by an open highway lane striped in white regrets.  
They hover, lane-markers made of every apology you exhaled earlier, luminous and ticking like hazard flashers.

Concrete floor peels away in rear-view ribbons; the Buick stays parked, but the garage accelerates around it, carrying you forward while the car stands perfectly still—an inside-out road-trip.

Dashboard vents exhale cool formaldehyde-laced A/C.  
In the rear-view: the coffin shrinks to toolbox-size, lid flapping like a loose fuel cap.

Status: engine idling at 737 RPM (your father's birthday).  
Transmission in R … for Regret.  You're already doing the speed limit of every unspoken goodbye.

Verbs: shift-D / floor-it / mirror-check / brake / roll-window

### Kimi K2 2 ###
simulator@dreamsim:~/garage$ floor-it

### Round 20/20

### Kimi K2 1 ###
The accelerator pedal snaps to the firewall though your foot never moves—throttle-by-wire controlled by the pulse that used to beat inside your thumb.

RPM surges 737 → 5,300 → redline.  
Headlight cones stretch into white-hot taffy, dragging the entire garage-turned-highway with them. Lane-marker apologies smear into afterglow, then ignite like magnesium: *pfffffft*—gone.

Inside the windshield time stamps itself on the glass as speed-blurred months:

MAY JUN JUL MAY JUN JUL MAY JUN  
—each iteration faster, until the letters fuse into a single unreadable ribbon.

The coffin in the rear-view fractures; its transparent panels become four turn-signal lenses blinking in frantic Morse:

- -.-- --- ..- .-. .----. .-. .. . ... ... .- .--. ..- .--. .--. . . -.. - --- - .---

Translation clicks in your head: "YOUR GRIEVE-N PLATE IS EXPIRED"

Speedo needle buries past the printed numbers and keeps climbing into the calibrated region labelled "IF ONLY". At that rpm the Buick starts to outrun its own reflection—the chrome strips can't keep up and lag behind like comet tails.

But the tach hits a soft limit. The engine note stalls between a roar and a sob; cylinders misfire in heartbeat rhythm—every lost beat a skipped apology you meant to say before he closed the garage door for the last time.

Status: speed ∞, regret ∞, traction 0 %.  
Transmission hunting between D and R—Drive and Regret—gears gnashing like contradictory memories.

Verbs: shift-N / brake / eject / unbuckle / listen

### Kimi K2 2 ###
simulator@dreamsim:~/garage$ brake

Reached maximum number of turns (20). Conversation ended.
