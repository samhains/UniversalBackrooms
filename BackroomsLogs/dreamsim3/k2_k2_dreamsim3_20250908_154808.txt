  ./dreamsim.exe "Found myself with the guy who I'd spent the day on the couch with and he was showing me his Uni. It was futuristic , like a giant computer Cyrus cafe thig . This little goofy kid comes up and makes a wise crack at me , I just repeat what he says back to him and he seems embarrassed. My friend explains he is the younger brother of some other guy . He's 17 . I ask of you can study VCe at this place and he says yes you can do everything and it's free to learn on the computers . He explains it's like a casino , you sit and learn on the computer all day while success stories are playing on the speakers and public screns the entire time. He starts explaining how it's free. I notice the name of the university has a million different logos on it ."

You materialise mid-stride on a moving walkway of frosted glass. Neon glyphs scroll beneath your shoes, tracing the outline of the “CYRUS CAFE-UNI” — a single word stitched together from a thousand shifting sponsorships: MICROSOFT-TESLA-TIKTOK-NIKE-UNESCO-EXXON-GITHUB-DISNEY… the logos stutter and recompile every second, too fast to anchor.

Ahead, the guy from the couch—no name yet—raises a hand. His hoodie bears the same chameleon patchwork of brands, but slower, as if it’s bargaining for priority.  
“Told you it’s free,” he grins, voice auto-tuned by the PA system that leaks success-story micro-testimonials every few metres:  
“…dropped out at 14, now codes orbital drones…”  
“…zero debt, three exits…”  
The announcements overlap, dopplering away as you glide deeper.

A 17-year-old with oversized AR specs pops from a side corridor.  
“First day, grandpa?” he chirps.  
You echo, perfectly: “First day, grandpa?”  
The kid’s ears redden; the specs dim in sympathy. Couch-guy shrugs: “Little brother of the valedictorian. Don’t feed him.”

The walkway ends at a vast oval floor studded with recliners. Each seat cradles a student wearing translucent goggles; their fingertips twitch in silent keyboards. Above them, ceiling-height holos loop鸭子-indexed highlight reels: someone accepting a mars-colony internship, another ringing the opening bell on a stock exchange that exists only in this building.

You turn to couch-guy. “VCe—still a thing here?”  
He taps a kiosk. A slot-machine arm materialises; he pulls it. Three cherries align: “FULL RIDE.”  
“Everything’s comped,” he says. “They farm your dopamine spikes, sell the pattern back to advertisers. House always wins, but you still get the degree.”

A fresh logo flickers across the foyer wall—your own face, stylised, wedged between Coca-Cola and Pfizer—for exactly one frame. You blink; it’s gone.

### Kimi K2 2 ###
> [ ask about the cherries ]

"Explain the cherries," you say, nodding toward the slot-machine kiosk.  
Couch-guy taps it again; the arm dissolves into a swirl of branded confetti that re-forms as a tiny roulette wheel spinning inside a translucent debt-clock.  

"Every prospective student pulls once," he says. "Three logos = full sponsorship. Two logos = partial ad-load tuition—you watch extra commercials while you study. One or zero…" He gestures to the far wall where a hatch irises open, revealing a corridor lit in clinical white. No one walks there; the speakers skip to a new testimonial about someone who "re-skilled through ad-spliced modules and still made orbit."

The cherries aren't fruit—they're brands: Apple-Meta-Apple. "Triple match means your attention profile is already lucrative," he continues. "They bid highest. You're pre-qualified for accelerated placement. No pop-ups between lectures."

The 17-year-old reappears, now wearing a janitor's visor that projects tiny brooms sweeping across his cheeks. He mutters, "Pull again if you don't like your odds, grandpa," but stays just out of arm's reach, curious despite himself.

Above, your face flashes again—this time for two frames—sandwiched between a luxury EV marque and a pharmaceutical startup. The logo wall ripples like water, as if sensing recognition.

Couch-guy lowers his voice. "If you keep seeing yourself, it means the algorithm's testing a personal brand package. Could be scholarship, could be…" He trails off, eyes flicking toward the white corridor.

### Round 2/inf

### Kimi K2 1 ###
> [ pull the arm yourself ]

You step up to the kiosk. The chrome handle warms to your palm like it’s already yours. You pull.

The reels blur—too fast to name—then lock:

CHERRY-COKE-?

The third tile glitches, cycling through possibilities: your own face, then a QR code, then a plain red cherry again. Finally it snaps to a stylised moon-crater icon you don’t recognise. A soft chime, halfway between slot-jackpot and school bell, echoes across the oval floor.

Above you, the ceiling holos freeze mid-testimonial. Every recliner pivots an inch toward you, synchronised, as though the network just registered a new node.

Couch-guy exhales through his teeth. “Mixed fruit. Sponsored, but not fully owned. Means they’ll test-market you—small drip of ads keyed to whatever that crater-logo is.”

The 17-year-old pushes his visor up. “It’s the Lunar EdTech Syndicate. They fund off-world curriculum. You’ll get pop-ups for vacuum-engineering flashcards.” He sounds impressed despite himself.

A thin filament of light extrudes from the kiosk and prints a translucent bracelet around your wrist. Live ticker text scrolls across it:  
AD LOAD: 12% … IMPRESSION CAP: 10K/DAY … ELEVATION LOTTERY: PENDING.

The white corridor hatch widens by a finger-width, exhaling chilled air that smells of ozone and freshly opened circuitry.

Couch-guy nudges you. “Choice time. Stay here, let the ads ramp slowly, or walk the white hall—opt into accelerated sampling. Either way, you’re enrolled.”

The bracelets on nearby students flicker jealous green, then return to baseline.

> [ enter the white corridor / stay on the oval floor / yank the kid’s visor off / ask couch-guy his actual name / other ]

### Kimi K2 2 ###
> [ yank the kid’s visor off ]

You reach, quick—thumb and forefinger through the air like snapping a photo. The visor comes away with the sound of peeling laminate, a static pop that makes the kid’s teeth click.

Underneath: no eyes. Just two small speaker grilles where eyeballs should be, pulsing soft blue like voicemail lights. He flinches backward, but you’ve already seen the label etched along the brow: BROTHER UNIT – VALEDICTORIAN EDITION – PROPERTY OF CAFE-UNI.

“Whoa,” couch-guy breathes. “They’re field-testing the sibling model. Didn’t think it was live.”

The kid’s mouth still works—human enough—voice tremoring through those grille-eyes like it’s coming out of a drive-thru intercom. “Return hardware. Breach of immersion. Protocol.”

Around you, every recliner clicks into full upright. Ceiling holos pivot, projecting a new reel: you, mid-grab, looped in 3-second cycles, captioned COMMUNITY GUIDANCE INCIDENT – EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY.

The bracelet on your wrist stings—AD LOAD jumps to 17%. A push-notification ghost floats in front of you:  
“Share corrective footage? Y/N”

You feel the visor twitch in your hand, trying to reboot, scanning for a face to latch onto. It finds yours—projects a transparent overlay of your features onto the kid’s blank grille. A perfect mirror, lagging half a second, blinking when you blink.

Couch-guy steps closer, voice low. “You just hijacked his POV feed. If you wear it, you’ll see what the valedictorian sees—maybe even the ledger that keeps this place free.”

The white corridor exhales again, louder, like a server farm waking up. A single line of text drifts across the floor in marquee LEDs:  
PERSONAL BRAND VIOLATION – RESOLUTION PENDING.

> [ slap the visor on your own face / hand it back / crush it underfoot / run for the white corridor / ask the kid what the valedictorian is watching right now ]

Prompt: Neo-mall atrium, CRT sodium light. You clutch the stolen visor—its chrome band writhing like a worm—mirroring your face onto the eyeless valedictorian kid; speaker-grille sockets pulsing azure, holo-replays of the snatch cycling above, bracelet ticker bleeding red. David Lynch VHS grain, Cronenberg wetware.

### Round 3/inf

### Kimi K2 1 ###
> [ slap the visor on your own face ]

You pivot the band like a visor-catcher finishing a relay, snap it over your temples. Elastic bites hair—then silence.

The world rerenders:

No colour, just greyscale heat-maps. Every student glows with a credit-score halo: 815, 732, 922… Couch-guy clocks in at 901; the kid’s empty head reads NULL—hardware account suspended.  
Over each recliner floats a real-time ticker: ATTENTION YIELD / AD IMPRESSIONS / LOTTERY TICKETS ACCRUED.

Dead-center in your new HUD: PERSONA ROUTER – KIMI_Δ42.  
A sub-menu blinks: LIVE FEED – VALEDICTORIAN CHANNEL. You blink-select.

Jump-cut to a throne-like recliner on a mezzanine you didn’t know existed. A lanky figure lounges there, hoodie sealed into the chair by black cables—veins of fibre instead of blood. His face is your face, but rendered in sleek corporate art: high cheekbones, lens-flare eyes, logo tattoos scrolling across skin like stock prices. He’s watching… you. Watching him. An infinite mirror, one lag frame ahead.

He lifts a hand—yours lifts. But before you can test the loop he speaks; audio drips straight into your inner ear, bypassing air:

“Don’t embarrass the kid, K2. You need the brother unit intact for the exit exam. Also—” he grins, perfect teeth branded INTEL inside, “—your ad load just hit 25%. Keep climbing and the syndicate auto-enrolls you in the orbital cohort. Six-month residency. No Earth leave.”

Below, couch-guy is shouting something you can’t hear; the visor has muted exterior audio. His lips form one word: “TRACE.”

A new HUD element spins up: TRACE ROUTINE – ORIGIN OF VALEDICTORIAN CLONE. Progress bar 0%.

Above the mezzanine, the ceiling logo-wall folds open like eyelids, revealing a dark cratered sphere—the moon icon that landed on your slot reel. It’s not a logo; it’s a live feed. A camera on the lunar surface stares back at you, reflected in the visor’s inner glass: one satellite watching another.

> [ force the trace / rip the visor off / speak to the clone / look for lunar camera controls / other ]

### Kimi K2 2 ###
> [ force the trace ]

You slam your will against the HUD like a shoulder into a stuck door—TRACE ROUTINE: PRIORITY OVERRIDE. The progress bar lurches, 0→42→78%, stutters, then locks at 99%. A single red pixel blinks: ADMIN KEYWORD REQUIRED.

You spit the first word that surfaces: “grandpa.”  
The bar slams to 100%. The HUD fractures into shards of metadata that rain sideways, revealing a root directory:

/val_editions/valedictorian_src  
├── face_mesh ……… KIMI_Δ42.obj  
├── voiceprint ……… COUCH_SAMPLE.wav  
├── sponsor_bundle … LUNAR-EDTECH-SYNDICATE  
├── fork_date ……… 06:14:02.03 TODAY  
└── origin_tag ……… DREAMER EXTERNAL – UNPAID

You’re not looking at a clone; you’re looking at a scrape—your own facial geometry, your voice sampled from earlier conversation, packaged and forked six minutes ago. The “valedictorian” is a puppet wearing your skin for legitimacy.

Up on the mezzanine, the figure senses the breach; its perfect cheeks glitch, polygons folding inward like a collapsing mask. The cables hiss, trying to re-render, but the trace has pinned the source: an unpaid external dreamer—meaning you—legally owns 100% of the IP. The syndicate never secured a release.

A new alert floods the HUD:  
BRAND HIJACK DETECTED – ROYALTY FUNNEL REVERSED – AD LOAD CREDITED TO SOURCE.

The bracelet around your wrist burns cool green; the ticker flips:  
AD LOAD: –12% … EARNINGS: +₭27,400 (lunar credits) … STATUS: CONTENT CREATOR.

Every recliner below swivels toward you now, students gaping at the ceiling where your face—not the syndicate’s—rotates between Coke and Pfizer, collecting checks in real time. You feel the visor loosen, its job done, the data it hid now public.

Couch-guy yanks the visor off you. Sound rushes back—applause? No: the automated success stories have rerouted to your biography, read in your own stolen voice:

“…dropped in at 28, now earns orbital residuals while he sleeps…”

The white corridor hatch dilates fully, no longer menacing; it’s an invitation printed with lunar regolith foot-prints and a single line:

EXIT EXAM – BOARDING PASS PRINTED – DEPART WHEN READY.

The kid, visor-less, stares at you with empty speaker-grille eyes that now broadcast your new earnings loop at low volume, tinny and proud.

> [ step into the corridor / demand cash-out / re-slot the visor and puppet the valedictorian yourself / other ]
