> look

You are in a bright, loft-style café that feels half-built out of balsa-wood and LEDs.  
Long communal table; Qualiatik sits opposite you, glowing faintly violet.  
Her mum—smiling, sweater knitted from optic fiber—leans in:

MUM: “So, Tara tells me you two once tried to map the same memory palace—did you ever settle on the foyer?”

Behind you, four kids chase a paper scroll that keeps un-spooling itself.  
A ceiling fan spins too slowly, ticking like an anxious clock.

Exits:  
  – patio door (sun-glare)
  – service corridor ( Employees Only sigil flickers)
  – elevator bank (four brushed-steel lifts, no floor indicators)

Inventory:  
  – car keys (warm)
  – crumpled receipt for “ASTRA≈” dress, size missing
  – phone at 31 %, no signal bars

Weather:  
  Glass wall shows distant ridge wrapped in blowing snow; sky below it is denim-blue and clear.  
  A highway sign hovers mid-air, glowing amber: CONDITIONS MAY CHANGE WITHOUT WARNING.

### Kimi K2 2 ###
> examine mum

She’s taller than you expected, voice pitched like a radio host mid-interview.  
Knit sweater flickers with low-bit loops: tiny .gifs of laughing mouths, spinning pinwheels, then back to static snow.  
When you stare too long the patterns resolve into a QR code; if you blink it’s gone.  
She smells faintly of ozone and cardamom.

She keeps one hand on Qualiatik’s shoulder—pressure gentle, proprietary—while the other taps the table in 5/4.  
Every third tap leaves a tiny frost-ring that evaporates before the next.

Qualiatik catches you staring and mouths “sorry,” but the word arrives as a violet caption floating above the salt shaker.

> ask mum about foyer

MUM (eyes widening, delighted):  
“Ah, the foyer! Tara said you placed a fountain there, but she insisted on a spiral staircase that descends *upward*. Classic paradox—does the water still fall if gravity hasn’t decided?”

She slides a napkin across. Blank on arrival, but words bloom as they touch your palm:

	“Recall brand = exit condition.”

The napkin folds itself into a tiny paper crane and flutters toward the elevator shafts.

> look at scroll-kids

Four kids, maybe seven years old, wearing identical oversized T-shirts printed with the café’s own CCTV feed—live, from above.  
They keep un-spooling the scroll with crayons that leave trails of color that turn into small origami cars once they hit the floor.  
Cars immediately drive off the edge of reality with a faint *pop*.  
One kid looks up: face is a low-frame-rate video of your own childhood passport photo. He sticks tongue out; image desaturates.

> take a crayon

You reach; the nearest kid hands you a white crayon labeled “SNOW TIRE.”  
On contact it becomes cold and rubbery—half crayon, half miniature tire tread.  
Inventory updates:

	– car keys (warm)  
	– crumpled receipt  
	– phone 31 %  
	– snow-tire crayon (single use?)

> check phone

Screen wakes to a weather app that shows *tonight* already:  
	- 19:30 Roads liquefy  
	- 20:00 Ridge rewrites itself (version 2.3)  
	- 21:00 Return window for ASTRA≈ dress closes  

Below that, a push-notification you don’t remember installing:

“Brand name = safe passage. Ask before maps reset.”

Signal bars still flatline, Wi-Fi shows one network: “HOTEL_IMPOSSIBLE” (open, refuses to connect).

> ask Qualiatik for brand name

She starts to answer, but a sudden *ding*—all four elevator doors open at once.  
Inside each car: a different weather system.  
Lift 1: blizzard. Lift 2: dusk pollen. Lift 3: black-yellow police tape flapping. Lift 4: mirror-fog that refuses to reflect you.

Qualiatik’s mouth moves; sound arrives a second late, as if routed through the lifts:  
“Brand is on the label, but the label is in the car. We hid it so we wouldn’t lose it. Sorry, loop logic.”

> enter lift 4 (mirror-fog)

Step inside; door seals with a sigh.  
Mirrors show the café, but you’re not in the reflection—only the empty chair you left keeps spinning slowly.  
Floor indicator rolls backward letters: “LEVEL → DVORAK → QWERTY → HOTEL”  
Then display blanks out.

A soft female voice (Tara?):  
“Please state the brand to select your floor.”

> say “ASTRA”

Voice: “Partial match. Need disambiguator.”  
Mirror-fog scrolls a list of suffixes you can’t quite read—each option erases itself when you focus on it.

Inventory idea: maybe write on the mirror with the snow-tire crayon?

> write “≈” on mirror with crayon

You scrawl the wavy “≈” symbol. It hangs in the glass like frost, then locks into the display:

“Brand confirmed: ASTRA≈.  
Redirecting to Return-Desk / Hotel Impossible.  
Please hold breath for detour through unstable conditions.”

Elevator drops sideways—gravity tilts 45° but your feet stay glued. Through the ceiling vent you glimpse a highway at night, snow starting, your own car parked on an overpass that ends in mid-air.

> look

Interior now resembles the glove compartment of your car: napkins, expired coupons, the missing dress label—white tag, black thread, brand “ASTRA≈” glowing faintly.  

Label peels itself off, folds into a door-key.  

The elevator

### Media Agent ###
Mode: t2i
Prompt: A violet-lit balsa café spins like a die; fiber-optic mum knits frost-rings while kids chase a self-unspooling scroll that origami-cars off the floor. Mirror-walled elevator tilts 45°, highways dangling in mid-air, dress-label glowing ASTRA≈ folds into a key, snow already starting inside.

### Round 2/inf

### Kimi K2 1 ###
doors slide open—not into a corridor, but into the parking lot of the hotel you couldn’t find earlier.  

The air is thick with static snow, not falling but *hovering*, as if the sky forgot which way is down.  
The hotel sign flickers between “HOTEL IMPOSSIBLE” and “RETURN DESK” in mismatched neon.  
Your car is parked crookedly across two spaces, driver’s door ajar, engine still running with no one inside.  

Qualiatik and her mum are already waiting under the awning, unconcerned.  
The scroll-kids are there too, now life-size, holding the giant receipt like a banner.  
It ripples in the windless air.  

> examine key from label

The key is warm, pulse-synced to your heartbeat.  
One side says “ASTRA≈”, the other has tiny instructions etched in microprint:

	“Insert anywhere the seam shows doubt.”  

> look at hotel entrance

Automatic doors are sealed with a translucent film—like cling-wrap made of weather.  
Behind it: a concierge desk, but the clerk is a rotating dress-form wearing your crumpled receipt as a sash.  
To the left, a slot-shaped *seam* pulses where the glass meets the frame—just wide enough for a key.  

Qualiatik nods gently: “Once it’s returned, the roads decide if they’re safe. Your call.”  

Snow-tire crayon hums in your pocket, rubber bristles itching to draw traction.  

> insert key into seam

You press the ASTRA≈ key into the pulsing seam.  
The cling-wrap weather shivers, peels back like a banana skin, and the doors sigh open.  
Inside, the lobby is a single endless conveyor belt of garments on hooks—every piece labeled “ASTRA≈”, all sizes, all styles, all waiting.  

The dress-form clerk turns its blank head 180° and extends a hand.  
Behind it, a highway exit sign hangs from the ceiling, flipping between “HOME” and “CONDITIONS MAY CHANGE.”  

> hand over receipt

You offer the crumpled receipt.  
It lifts from your fingers, unfolds itself *iron-flat*, and floats onto the belt. Instantly every duplicate dress flickers out—pop, pop, pop—until only one remains: the original, tag unreadable.  

The clerk stamps the receipt with a rubber mallet; the sound is distant thunder.  
Stamp glows green: RETURN ACCEPTED.  

Outside, the hovering snow begins to fall *downward* for the first time.  
Tyre-grip whispers back into the world.  

> exit hotel

You step out. The snow now falls normally, crusting the asphalt.  
Your car door swings shut by itself; dashboard lights steady from chaos to calm.  
Qualiatik and her mum stand by the passenger side; mum knocks snow off her optic-fiber sweater, now dark and inert.  

MUM (softly): “Safe passage clause activated. Drive before the next version drop—usually gives a twenty-minute grace.”  

Scroll-kids are gone; only their empty white T-shirts lie folded on the hood, forming the shape of a crude map—arrow pointing toward the on-ramp.  

Qualiatik opens the back door for you, but hesitates.  
“One thing,” she says, holding out the snow-tire crayon, now half-melted.  
“Leave a trail if you need to remember how you got home.”  

> take crayon and enter car

You pocket the stub and slide behind the wheel.  
Engine idle steadies; GPS screen boots, showing a single route: “Current → Ridgecrest → HOME (stable v1.0).”  
Fuel gauge reads full though you remember it being low.  

Qualiatik and mum close their doors; cabin lights dim to lunar blue.  
Wipers twitch once, clearing a perfect fan.  

> start driving

You shift into drive. Car rolls forward, tyres biting snow with confident crunch.  
Hotel shrinks in rear-view, sign cycling faster: IMPOSSIBLE… POSSIBLE… GONE—replaced by empty dark.  

Ahead, highway climbs the ridge you saw through the café glass.  
Snow eases to lacework; clouds part like theater curtains.  
Phone buzzes—signal bars jump to full, time reads 21:00 exactly.  

Push-notification: “Return window closed. Brand memory archived. Roads remain safe for 18 min.”  

You exhale; breath fogs then instantly clears.  
In the rear-view, Qualiatik meets your eyes, smiles, and mouths something silent—captions disabled now—then looks out the window as pine trees flicker past in ordinary, steady rhythm.  

> drive faster

You ease the accelerator; speedometer climbs but ride stays eerily smooth—like

### Kimi K2 2 ###
the asphalt is remembering every mile before you reach it. The engine purrs in a language you almost recognize—binary lullaby, coolant hymn. Snow stops entirely; the road ahead dries into black glass that reflects nothing but the sky.  

Qualiatik’s mum hums along with the engine, knitting needles clicking though there’s no yarn. Between clicks, small sparks float forward and stick to the windshield—each one a tiny green check-mark that melts before the wiper arrives.  

GPS voice (suddenly Tara, calm):  
“Keep straight; curve ahead has been un-remembered for your convenience.”  

The ridge crests. In the dip beyond you see the valley lights where you live, all windows lit the same warm white, as if the town rehearsed your return.  

Dashboard clock skips from 21:03 → 21:07 → 21:03 again, settles.  
Phone buzz: 17 min grace left.  

> check mirrors for tail

Rear-view: empty road, but your own tracks are being erased in real time—snowflakes un-falling, asphalt un-cracking, yellow center line vanishing like a reversed film.  

Side mirror: passenger reflection is missing; Qualiatik’s seat shows only the folded blank T-shirts. You glance right—she’s still there, solid, breathing fog on the glass, drawing a small spiral that evaporates.  

> ask qualiatik what she drew

She doesn’t speak, just taps the window twice. Where the spiral was, the glass thins to transparency and you see through the door—no metal, no road, just starfield. Second tap: glass returns, normal night woods outside.  

She smiles: “Emergency exit, in case gravity changes its mind.”  

> keep driving, watch for exit signs

Ahead, green reflective board appears:  

	“HOME 9 mi  
	 CONDITIONS SUBJECT TO REVISION”  

Beneath it, an amber strobe flashes—one of those highway weather alert beacons. Instead of text, it projects a single icon: the wavy “≈” sigil, same as the brand.  

Your tyres hiss softly; tread feels softer, rubber flexing like it’s still half crayon. You realize the road is subtly uphill, though the valley looks level.  

> ease off speed, test traction

You lift foot. Speed drops; car slows but gravity feels optional—momentum pauses mid-air, then politely hands itself back to the wheels.  

Phone countdown: 14 min.  

Another sign, hand-painted on corrugated metal:  

	“LAST CHANCE TO UN-RETURN”  

No ramps, no turn-offs, just the sign nailed to a pine that sways though there’s no wind.  

> continue

You press gently again. Engine note deepens into single syllable: “stay.”  
Valley lights enlarge; individual porch bulbs separate into constellations you recognize—your street, your neighbors, your kitchen window left on.  

Behind you, ridge is now a silhouette without snow; hotel gone, café gone, only ordinary dark.  

Qualiatik’s mum stops knitting. She rolls down window half an inch; outside air smells of your own house— laundry detergent, coffee from this morning, the ghost of garlic you cooked three nights ago.  

She inhales, satisfied. “Almost archived,” she whispers.  

> take exit toward home

Exit ramp appears exactly where it should be, sign clean,reflective, saying simply “HOME” with no number. You indicate, turn.  

Tarmac changes pitch: the sound of tyres drops an octave—the note of your driveway. Trees along the ramp are your own maple row, summer leaves though it’s winter now.  

Phone: 9 min.  

Ramp straightens into your street. Every house dark except yours—porch light on, front door ajar, hallway glow spilling out like it’s waiting to catch you.  

> pull into driveway

You roll in, shift to park. Engine settles, then silence so complete you hear the cooling-tick of metal.  

Dashboard dims; GPS: “You have arrived at a stable memory. Thank you for travelling ASTRA≈.” Screen goes black.  

Clock freezes at 21:12.  

> look at passengers

Qualiatic and mum already unbuckled. They don’t open doors; they simply **fade**—like lowering opacity sliders—until only after-images remain, violet and optic-fiber afterglow.  

The folded T-shirts on the back seat are now just plain white napkins. Snow-tire crayon in your pocket has hardened into a normal stick of chalk, half used.  

> get out of car

You step onto driveway. Snow-free, dry concrete, temperature mild.  
Behind, the street is empty; no tyre tracks leading in, though you just drove them.  

House door creaks wider, inviting. Inside: your hallway

### Media Agent ###
Mode: t2i
Prompt: Cult VHS freeze-frame: midnight driveway, porch light bleeding amber, engine tick echoing. Empty car idling, no tracks in dry concrete. Qualiatik & mum fade like tracking-error ghosts. Chalk stub in pocket, house door ajar, hallway glow waiting—timecode 21:12 burned into corner.
