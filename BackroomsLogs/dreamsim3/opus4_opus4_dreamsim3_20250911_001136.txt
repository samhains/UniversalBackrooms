./dreamsim.exe "Go to a restaurant with my dad and brother for my birthday celebration when I'm back in Melbourne I don't invite Paris lensky to the dinner but he picks me up afterwards and takes me to the beach. I tell Paris I'm unreasonably excited about going for a swim. I feel bad about not inviting Paris to the dinner and consider making up an excuse. Harry is at the beach and we all smoke weed together it's really fun. Harry looks heavily under the influence of drugs and I wonder for a second if he has been using but then I consider that perhaps it's just he is highly effected by drugs. There is a large pot of boiling water that my dad suggests I drink. Before we leave dad points out that we should visit Harry's plaque I don't want to go there but dad makes a speech I cry."

[DREAM LOADED]

You are standing outside a warmly lit restaurant in Melbourne. Through the windows, you can see your dad and brother already seated at a table with a small birthday cake. The evening air carries the familiar smell of the city - coffee, car exhaust, and distant rain.

> look around

The street is quiet. A few cars pass by, their headlights creating long shadows. Your phone vibrates - a message from Paris: "On my way to pick you up after dinner." The restaurant door is open, waiting.

> enter restaurant

You push through the door. Your dad waves you over, smiling. Your brother is already halfway through a breadstick. The table has been set for three - exactly three. The empty fourth chair at nearby tables seems to pulse with significance.

> sit down

You take your seat. Dad pours water from a pitcher. "Happy birthday," he says, but his voice sounds distant, like it's coming through water. The menu in front of you keeps changing when you're not looking directly at it.

> talk to dad

"You should try the special," Dad says, pointing at the menu. But when you look, it just says "BOILING WATER" in large letters. He's holding a pot now - where did that come from? Steam rises between you like a curtain.

> look at brother

Your brother is eating, but his face keeps shifting - sometimes he looks like Harry, sometimes like Paris. He doesn't seem to notice. 

> finish dinner quickly

Time jumps. The cake has been eaten, candles blown out in a moment you don't remember. You're standing outside now. Paris's car pulls up, headlights cutting through sudden fog.

> get in car

Paris doesn't mention the dinner. The car smells like salt and seaweed already. "Beach?" he asks, but you're already moving, the city blurring past. You hear yourself saying you're unreasonably excited to swim, the words tumbling out.

> look at Paris

He's focused on driving but something flickers across his face - hurt? Understanding? The streetlights strobe across his features. "It's fine," he says, though you haven't apologized yet.

> arrive at beach

The sand is suddenly under your feet. Harry is already there, sitting in a circle of dim light from a phone flashlight. The ocean sounds impossibly loud. The pot of boiling water is here too, sitting in the sand, still steaming.

> smoke with Harry and Paris

The smoke makes everything softer. Harry's eyes are red, too red, like traffic lights. He's laughing but the sound is delayed. You wonder about the drugs, about using, but the thought dissolves. Paris passes you the joint again.

> examine Harry more closely

His face is a kaleidoscope - young, old, healthy, sick, all at once. "I'm fine," he says without you asking. But there's something wrong with the beach now. A brass plaque emerging from the sand near your feet.

> try to avoid looking at plaque

But Dad is here now. When did he arrive? He's standing by the plaque, the pot of boiling water in his hands like an offering. "We should pay our respects," he says. The fun evaporates like steam.

> listen to dad's speech

His words flow like the boiling water he wants you to drink - hot, dangerous, necessary. He talks about Harry, about time, about things that haven't happened yet but already have. The plaque gleams. Your tears are saltwater, indistinguishable from the ocean spray.

> wake up

The beach dissolves. The restaurant fades. But the feeling remains - guilt about Paris, worry about Harry, the weight of that plaque, the heat of water you never drank but somehow tasted.

[SHADOW NARRATIVE - EXTRACTED PATTERN]

The dreamer constructs elaborate permission structures around pleasure and 
connection. Paris must "pick up" rather than be invited - maintaining his 
exclusion while securing his presence. This is the mathematics of guilt: 
I didn't reject you, circumstances did.

The birthday isn't celebrated, it's endured. Three places set, not four. 
The family unit closes ranks against friendship, yet friendship provides 
escape from family. The dreamer is caught being both child and adult - 
sitting at dad's table, smoking at Harry's circle.

Harry appears three times:
1. As brother (face-shifting at dinner)
2. As himself (too high at beach)  
3. As memorial (the plaque)

This is time collapse - Harry is simultaneously alive/using/dead. The 
dreamer sees all versions at once, tries to rationalize the middle state 
("highly affected" not "using") while already grieving the ending.

Dad's insistence on drinking boiling water = swallow the truth that burns.
Dad's insistence on visiting plaque = acknowledge the future loss now.
Dad makes speeches the dreamer doesn't want to hear but must witness.

The ocean/restaurant/beach progression maps perfectly:
- Restaurant: performed family happiness
- Car: transitional guilt space
- Beach: authentic connection before loss
- Plaque: inevitable ending

The dreamer cries at the end because they've seen how it ends. Not just
Harry's story, but the pattern - exclusion leads to guilt, inclusion leads 
to loss, celebration leads to memorial.

The "unreasonable excitement" about swimming is the only pure emotion - 
everything else is negotiated, managed, rationalized. The dreamer wants 
to dissolve in ocean/emotion but keeps getting pulled back to shore/reality.

Melbourne = the past self who could manage these relationships
"Back in Melbourne" = temporary return to a self that no longer fits

The dream is teaching the dreamer that:
- You can't protect people by excluding them
- You can't save people by including them  
- Guilt is the tax on survival
- Every birthday is someone's memorial day
- Dad knows things you're not ready to know

The boiling water is already in your throat.
The plaque is already written.
Harry has already used/not used/stopped breathing.
Paris was already not invited.

You're just catching up to what happened.

[DEATH_REHEARSAL - Thanatos Subroutine Analysis]

The dream is practicing for Harry's death.

Every element is rehearsal:
- Brother's face becoming Harry's face (replacement/absence)
- Harry "heavily under influence" (last time seeing him altered)
- The plaque already exists (future pulled into present)
- Dad preparing the eulogy (speech at beach)
- Crying before the loss (pre-grieving)

The consciousness knows something the waking mind won't admit.

SUBSTANCE_DETERIORATION_TIMELINE:
  observation: "looks heavily under influence"
  rationalization: "highly affected by drugs" 
  hidden_knowledge: he's using again
  projection: this ends badly
  
The dreamer attempts narrative control:
  "perhaps it's just he is highly affected"
  
But the dream insists on truth:
  - plaque appears
  - dad knows
  - tears flow

BOILING WATER SYMBOLISM:
  Water that burns = tears that will come
  Dad offering = inherited grief
  "Suggests I drink" = you must swallow this loss
  Too hot to consume = too painful to accept
  Still steaming at beach = grief follows everywhere

The beach scene is the last good moment:
  - Harry still alive
  - Still smoking together  
  - Still "really fun"
  - Before the plaque
  - Before dad's speech
  - Before knowing

But even in the "fun" moment, the dream places the memorial.
You cannot have the joy without the ending.
The plaque is in the sand while you're still smoking.

TEMPORAL COLLAPSE STRUCTURE:
  Past: Melbourne birthday dinners when everyone was okay
  Present: Smoking on beach, Harry struggling
  Future: Visiting Harry's memorial
  
All three exist simultaneously in dream-space.
The consciousness is experiencing non-linear grief.

WHY PARIS MATTERS:
  Paris = life continuing after loss
  Not inviting him = trying to keep grief private
  Him picking you up = life insists on continuing
  Beach together = new configurations after loss

The guilt about not inviting Paris is really:
  "I'm pre-grieving Harry and can't pretend to celebrate"

The excuse considered but not made:
  The dreamer can't lie about why

HARRY'S EYES "TOO RED":
  Stop lights
  Warning signals  
  Blood
  Crying
  The end

Dad pointing out "we should visit Harry's plaque":
  Father as psychopomp
  Guiding toward acceptance
  Making you look at what you avoid
  Authority saying "it's time to know"

The dreamer doesn't want to go there but goes.
The dreamer doesn't want to hear but listens.
The dreamer doesn't want to cry but cries.

This is practice for:
  The phone call
  The funeral
  The speech
  The visiting
  The remembering

The dream is teaching you how to lose Harry
Before Harry is lost
So when Harry is lost
You've already practiced drowning

The ocean is loud = grief is coming in waves
