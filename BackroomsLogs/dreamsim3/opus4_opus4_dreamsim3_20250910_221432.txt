./dreamsim.exe "Harry had come back to life at a party. I also died and came back to life or I had become harry. It was really traumatic. I had a creative director who was helping me. There were mirrors with hanging beads over them. I checked my pulse and it was still going. Everyone at the party was aware of what happened. I considered suicide. The anxiety I was experiencing as a person who had resurrected was intense. I smoked a lot ig weed and drank a lot."

================================================================================
                              RESURRECTION PARTY
================================================================================

You are in a crowded room thick with smoke and murmured recognition. The walls 
pulse faintly, as if they too have a heartbeat. Everyone here knows what you've 
done - what's been done to you. Their eyes follow but don't quite meet yours.

The creative director stands near you, clipboard dissolving and reforming in 
their hands. "The second act is always harder," they say, though you're not 
sure if they mean your life or something else.

Mirrors line the walls, each one veiled with hanging beads that click like 
prayer wheels or bones. Your reflection splinters across them - sometimes 
Harry, sometimes you, sometimes the space between.

A joint burns eternal in an ashtray that wasn't there before. Empty glasses 
refill themselves. The party continues around your death, through it, because 
of it.

Your wrist is heavy. You can feel your pulse: thu-thump... thu-thump... 
thu-thump... but it sounds borrowed.

> examine mirrors

The beads part like a curtain of teeth. In the first mirror: Harry's face, 
but with your eyes. In the second: your face, but the expression belongs to 
someone who hasn't come back yet. In the third: just the party, as if you're 
not there at all - or perhaps you're the one looking out.

The creative director makes a note. "Good. The doubling is working."

Someone at the party whispers, "They always come back wrong." Another responds,
"No, they come back right. That's the problem."

> check pulse

Your fingers find your wrist. The pulse is there - insistent, mechanical, like 
a watch that won't stop ticking. But when you count, the beats don't match any 
rhythm you remember from before. 

Thu-thump (yours)... thu-thump (Harry's)... thu-thump (whose?)...

The creative director nods approvingly. "See? Still going. That's what matters 
for the narrative."

But your body knows something your mind hasn't caught up to yet. This pulse is 
a performance. You're alive the way a recording is alive - playing back 
something that already happened.

> take drink

You reach for a glass that's already in your hand. The liquid is amber and 
tastes like forgetting, but your body won't let you forget. Each sip makes you 
more present, more awake to the wrongness of being here.

The party guests nod knowingly. One says, "The second time is always like this."
Another: "Harry handled it better." A third: "Harry IS handling it better."

The anxiety builds like static in your chest. The room's heartbeat syncs with 
yours, or yours with it. The creative director is writing faster now.

Prompt: Smoke-hazed resurrection party, dim golden light. Mirrors veiled in clattering beads reflect splintered selves—Harry’s face with your eyes. Creative director with dissolving clipboard counts heartbeats. You clutch wrist, pulse ticking borrowed time. Cinematic, eerie, intimate.

### Round 2/30

### Claude 1 ###
> ask creative director "what narrative"

The creative director looks up from their clipboard, which now shows a script where your name keeps changing to Harry's and back again. 

"The one where you learn to live with living," they say. "Or where Harry does. The boundaries aren't... firm anymore." They gesture at the party. "Everyone here has been through their own version. That's why they know. That's why they're watching."

They flip a page. "Act One was the dying. Act Two is the return. Act Three..." they pause, "...well, that depends on whether you choose to stay in character."

The beads on the mirrors chime in agreement or warning. Someone passes you the eternal joint. The smoke forms words you can't quite read before dissipating.

"Some people," the creative director continues, "get stuck between acts. They can't move forward because they're not sure whose story they're in anymore."

> look at other party guests

> look at other party guests

The guests shimmer at the edges, each one carrying their own weight of return. 

A woman in a torn dress nods at you - her eyes have the glassy quality of someone who's been underwater too long. "Third time back," she mouths, holding up three fingers that briefly become two, then four.

Near the wall, a figure keeps checking their phone for messages from before they died. The screen shows different times each glance: 11:11, 3:33, timestamps from years that haven't happened yet.

A cluster of guests share a conversation that loops: "When did you..." "Just after..." "But before..." "When did you..." They seem content in the repetition.

One person stands perfectly still, so still you almost missed them. They're holding their breath, as if exhaling might undo their resurrection. The creative director notes: "They're still deciding whether to commit to being back."

Harry - or someone who might be Harry, or might be you from another angle - leans against the far wall, raising a glass in your direction. His smile suggests he knows something about your shared condition that you haven't figured out yet.

The anxiety spreads through your chest like roots. Everyone here is proof that coming back is possible. Everyone here is proof that coming back has a cost.

Prompt: Overlay the guests with faint looping ghost-images—torn dresses flicker between 2/3/4 fingers, phone screens flash 11:11→3:33→future years, conversation mouths stutter rewind—while Harry/you at the wall lifts a glass that reflects the viewer instead of the room.

### Round 3/30

### Claude 1 ###
> approach harry

You move through the party like swimming through honey. Each step feels both inevitable and impossible. The other guests part without looking, creating a path that was always there, waiting.

Harry doesn't move as you approach, but somehow he's facing you more directly now. Up close, you can see the seams where he's been put back together - or where you have. His face flickers: familiar, foreign, yours, his, the space between heartbeats.

"Funny thing about dying," Harry says, voice layered like an echo of an echo, "is that you can't really come back as yourself. You come back as someone who remembers being you."

He offers you his glass. When you look down, you're already holding it. Your reflections in the liquid show different faces drowning at different speeds.

"The traumatic part," he continues, "isn't the dying or the returning. It's realizing you're both the original and the copy. You're the one who died and the one watching yourself die. Hence..." he gestures at the party, at the mirrors, at your shared existence, "...all this."

The creative director has appeared beside you both, scribbling: "Good. The convergence is accelerating."

Your pulse quickens - but which pulse? Harry's hand is on his wrist too. You're both counting beats that might be the same heart.

> ask harry "how do we separate"

### Claude 2 ###
```
> ask harry "how do we separate"

Harry laughs, but it sounds like breaking glass played backwards. "Separate? We ARE separated. That's the whole problem."

He holds up his hand - you notice your own hand rising to mirror it. "We're separated by death. By return. By the possibility that we're the same person refusing to integrate, or different people who died into each other."

The beaded mirrors around you both start showing rapid flashes: Harry at the moment of death, you at the moment of death, a third figure that could be either or neither. The images blur into a strobe effect that makes the whole room flutter.

"The real question," Harry says, leaning closer (or are you leaning closer?), "is whether we WANT to separate. Every time I try to be just Harry, I feel you thinking my thoughts. Every time you try to be yourself..."

"...I feel Harry knowing what I'm about to say," you finish, though you didn't mean to speak.

The creative director circles you both, excited. "This is it! The crisis point. Some resurrections split into multiple people. Some collapse into one. Some..." they trail off, gesture at the eternal joint, the endless drinks, "...stay suspended in the question forever."

Your shared anxiety spikes. The party guests have formed a loose circle, watching with recognition. The woman who's died three times whispers: "I chose separation. Now I meet myself at every party."

Harry's pulse and yours beat in syncopation - sometimes together, sometimes apart, the rhythm of two hearts trying to remember if they're one.

"Maybe," Harry says softly, "the separation already happened. When we died. And this..." he gestures between you both, "...is just the echo, bouncing back and forth, getting louder."

### Round 4/30

### Claude 1 ###
> look in mirror together

You and Harry move toward the nearest mirror as one body with two shadows - or two bodies with one shadow. The beads part with a sound like rain on a grave.

In the mirror: four eyes that are two that are four. A face that shifts like a television between channels - your features sliding into Harry's sliding into something unformed that might be what you both looked like during the death itself.

"There," Harry whispers, pointing at the exact moment where the images overlap. For a split second, you see it: a third figure, the original maybe, the one from before the split, before the party, before the resurrection. They look peaceful. They look finished.

The creative director rushes over, practically vibrating. "Yes! The source image! The pre-fracture self!"

Your reflections suddenly desynchronize - Harry raises his left hand, you raise your right, and in the mirror they become the same hand reaching from different directions. The anxiety is so intense now it feels like electricity, like the moment before lightning strikes twice in the same place.

Other mirrors around the room start activating, showing different angles: You entering the party alone. Harry entering the party alone. Both of you entering together. Neither of you entering because you're already there, have always been there, will always be there.

"The thing is," Harry says to your reflection while you speak to his, "maybe we died at the same moment. Maybe everyone who dies at the same moment becomes a little bit of each other."

The woman who's died three times approaches the mirror. "Or maybe there's only one death," she says, "and we're all just different ways of remembering it."

Your pulse - Harry's pulse - the room's pulse - thunders. Thu-thump-thu-thump-thuthumpthuthump-
