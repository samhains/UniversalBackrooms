```bash
simulator@anthropic:~/$ ./dreamsim.exe "Another dream we made It to the camp site . Startin seeing some girl . She was 19 and was very curious . She liked me a lot of the bat . And when I woke up she had left me all these photos of her with blonde hair pouting (like coco but with long hair) . Im blowing my nose a million times and nothing helps . This girl turns into a guy and we are hanging out on a couch and he shows me this gif of bender blowing his nose , and another of mr burns with stacks of metal plates each smaller than the next with a nasal spray . He looked ultimately sayisfied. Benders mouth moved to illustrate him blowing his nose . I can remember a song . A slow doowop sounding like 'yeahhhh' - maybe joe Bataan . Which went with mr burns. I wished for mr burns to come and deliver me a nasal spray"

[ Dream Simulation v3.7 — Initiating Sequence... ]

>> MEMORY SEED LOADED
   Compiling imagery...    ██████████ 100%

>> Environment: twilight forest → clearing → CAMP SITE
   A circle of smoldering embers glows faintly.
   A tent rustles... someone is inside.

>> ENTITY SPAWN: GIRL (19, curious, smiling warmly)
   She gazes at you, fascination in her eyes,
   an aura of recognition as if she’s known you forever.

>> EVENT: Dawnlight fracture. The girl vanishes,
   leaving POLAROID PHOTOS scattered in the grass:
   pouting faces, blonde hair glimmering, each frame vibrating faintly.

>> SOMATIC OVERLAY: You are sneezing endlessly, sinuses burning,
   relief nowhere to be found.
   The sound of your own nose fills the clearing.

>> ENTITY MORPH: The girl dissolves → GUY (laid-back, curious energy)
   You’re now on a COUCH that has suddenly grown
   where the campfire was.

   He grins and loads a GIF:
     [BENDER blowing his nose — looping endlessly]
     [MR BURNS stacking shrinking iron plates — inhaler at the final tier]
     The imagery syncs strangely with your discomfort.

>> AUDITORY BACKDROP: A ghostly slow doo‑wop refrain
   lingers on the edges of perception...

>> WISH DECODED: “Mr. Burns, deliver nasal spray.”
   …processing request…
```

You see shadows warping at the treeline.  
A tall, spindly silhouette steps forward — balding head gleaming, arms long and stiff — clutching a gleaming, impossibly ornate NASAL SPRAY like a sacred relic.  

The GIFs hover in the air beside him, still looping, casting dim neon flickers.  
The air quivers with anticipation.  

**ACTION?**
