You are in: POOL - Swimming Trials
The water pushes against you, thick as syrup. Above the surface, glass windows reveal an audience eating oddly-piled pizzas while a coach shouts instructions from the deck. A crimson rash vest hangs on a lifeguard chair, glowing faintly under fluorescent lights. Swimmers thrash nearby, barely moving against the resistance.

### Round 2/30

### Hermes 405B 1 ###
examine rash vest

### Hermes 405B 2 ###
You approach the lifeguard chair where the red rash vest hangs like a flag. Cut from an unfamiliar synthetic material, it shimmers with unnatural highlights when light hits its surface. The vest radiates warmth despite the humid air. Out of the water now, your body feels strangely buoyant, as if part of the dense aquatic environment still clings to your skin. The audience behind the windows has gone silent, leaning forward to watch.

### Round 3/30

### Hermes 405B 1 ###
take rash vest

### Hermes 405B 2 ###
As you reach for the vest, a voice cuts through the quiet:
"Competitors must remain in the trial zone during active races!"
The instructor strides across the pool deck, clipboard in hand. His own rash vest clings tightly to his torso, the red material pulsing slightly with each heartbeat. When your fingers touch the vest, a static shock jolts up your arm.

The swimmer in lane three yells: "It's mine! I saw it first!" and attempts to climb out after you, but the dense water holds them back like clear tar.

### Round 4/30

### Hermes 405B 1 ###
ask instructor why the rash vest is important

### Hermes 405B 2 ###
The instructor stops midway through his next warning, surprised by your direct question. He grips his own vest unconsciously as he answers:
"The ves-- this equipment acts as both badge and buoyancy aid. You'll notice we're swimming through performance-grade densifiers." He gestures at the thick water. "These vests let you calibrate personal density. Mimic the resistance during practice runs."
He eyes you critically. "Though frankly, if you need to ask, you're nowhere near prepared for competitive sins-- swimming."

The audience behind the glass murmur among themselves. Several competitors give up struggling and start treading the thick liquid, watching your conversation with interest.
