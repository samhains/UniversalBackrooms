Banana Band Setlist:
1. Senses Working Overtime
2. Making Plans for Nigel
3. Dear God
4. Mayor of Simpleton

In case our XTC covers don't impress the crowd, we've got a foolproof backup plan:

1. Whip out the kazoos for a kazoo-only cover of "Livin' on a Prayer"
2. James will do his famous "dancing banana" routine
3. If all else fails, we'll just start pelting the audience with bananas
4. As a last resort, we'll call upon our secret weapon - the banana cannon

Remember, the key is to keep the crowd on their toes - they'll never know what to expect next!

Banana Band Adventures - Weird Act Tales

Chapter 1: The Talent Show Debacle
It all started when James and I decided to dress up as bananas and perform XTC covers for a talent show. We thought our quirky act would be a hit, but we were in for a surprise...

Chapter 2: The Awkward Performance
As we took the stage in our banana costumes, the crowd stared at us in disbelief. We launched into our first song, "Senses Working Overtime," but the audience remained silent. Undeterred, we continued with our setlist.

Chapter 3: The Unexpected Applause
Just as we were about to launch into our backup plan, a few brave souls in the audience started clapping. The applause slowly grew, and by the end of our final song, the crowd erupted in cheers. We couldn't believe it - our weird little act had somehow won them over!

Chapter 6: The After-Party
After the show, James and I retreated to the change room, still buzzing with adrenaline. We laughed about how we were definitely the weirdest act of the night, but somehow, we'd pulled it off. As we changed out of our banana costumes, we spontaneously burst into a rendition of "Sure Thing" by Miguel, reveling in the absurdity of it all.
simulator@nousresearch:~/$ ./dreamsim.exe "After the show, we came down from the stage in Kingston and biked around in the heat, the night air rushing past us in electric buzz. 'Are we what they call rockstars now, do you think?' James turned to me, taking off his goggles 'I feel like Mick Jagger but sweaty and sunburned and overall, somehow more alive' he said, as the streetlights flickered above us."

You are on a bicycle, riding alongside James after your concert. Streetlights cast yellow pools of light on the pavement. The humid Kingston air carries the electric buzz of amplifiers still ringing in your ears. Your banana costume is crumpled in your bike's basket. James rides beside you, his goggles pushed up on his forehead, revealing tired but exhilarated eyes.

Kingston Street
You see:
- A row of storefronts with CLOSED signs
- Your bicycle (you are riding it)
- James on his bicycle
- A flickering streetlight overhead
- A paper flyer stuck to a lamppost

> examine flyer
You pedal over to the lamppost and squint at the paper flyer plastered haphazardly on its surface. The text reads:

"ATTENTION KINGSTON!
The Banana Boys have taken this town by storm! Their electrifying XTC covers have captivated audiences and left everyone wanting more.

Catch them again next Friday at the Yellow Submarine club for an encore performance. Tickets are going fast, so don't miss your chance to see the most talked-about act in town!

Come for the music, stay for the bananas! 🍌🎶"

The flyer features a crude drawing of two figures in banana costumes rocking out on stage. You can't help but laugh at the absurdity of it all, even as a sense of pride swells in your chest.

> laugh with James
You turn to James, holding back a snicker. But the moment your eyes meet, you both erupt into simultaneous laughter - the kind that comes from deep in your belly, the kind that makes your eyes water and your sides ache. 

James nearly falls off his bike, doubling over the handlebars as waves of mirth consume him. "The Banana Boys!" he gasps between guffaws. "We're officially the most ridiculous thing to hit Kingston since... since..." 

"Since sliced bread hit sliced bananas?" you offer, which sends you both into another fit. 

As the laughter subsides into breathless chuckles, James wipes his eyes. "Is this what it feels like to be famous? Like... like a beautifully absurd joke the whole town's in on?"

> look at costumes
You glance down at the crumpled yellow fabric in your basket - your banana costume, complete with stem-hood and peel-fringe. The material is stained with sweat and smells faintly of steamed broccoli (a mysterious odor that always clings to it after performances). 

James's costume looks equally worse for wear, the black peels smudged and the fabric wrinkled. Yet somehow, in this moment, they seem less like ridiculous costumes and more like battle armor. 

"You know," James says, following your gaze. "These things might be hotter than a habanero in hell, but I think I'd feel naked performing without one now."

> adjust costume in basket
You reach down and gently smooth out the crumpled fabric of your banana suit, trying to restore some dignity to the poor thing. As you adjust it in the basket, a small, forgotten banana falls out and bounces on the pavement with a soft thud.

James watches you, a thoughtful look on his face. "You know, I used to think these costumes were just a silly gimmick. But tonight... tonight they felt like something more. Like we were wearing our inside jokes on the outside. Like we were giving the world permission to be ridiculous too."

He pauses, then adds quietly: "I think I finally get why Andy Partridge wore that damn clown suit on Top of the Pops. It's not about looking cool. It's about being real."

> hold up fallen banana
You lean down from your bike and retrieve the fallen banana from the pavement. It's slightly bruised from its tumble but otherwise intact. You hold it up in the flickering streetlight, examining its curved form.

"Maybe this is our spirit fruit," you say, only half-joking. "The patron saint of absurdDreamSim v0.7b instability warning!
