[DREAMSIM STARTED]

You find yourself in a bustling department store, reminiscent of a Myers store. As you look around, you notice people marching through the building in orderly formations, as if they were part of an army. The store is incredibly busy, with shoppers rushing about in every direction.

Coco and her mother are with you, and Coco seems to be on a shopping spree, purchasing various items with her mother's money. To your surprise, she even buys a PlayStation 1 for a whopping $390. By the time you realize the exorbitant price, it's too late - her mother has already paid for it.

Concerned about Coco's mother using this as a power play, you mention to Coco that you have a PlayStation at home that she can have. You ask, "Is it too late to take it back? Could you use a store credit here?"

Coco confirms that she could indeed use a store credit. With this information, you head back inside the store, determined to return the overpriced PlayStation 1.

As you make your way through the store, a mischievous thought crosses your mind. You consider stealing a MacBook Air and hiding it inside your own MacBook Air case, which already contains your personal MacBook. The temptation is strong, but the decision is yours to make.

> look around 

You take a moment to survey your surroundings more closely. The store is a whirlwind of activity, with shoppers bustling about and the sound of chatter filling the air. The marching formations of people add an eerie, almost militaristic vibe to the otherwise typical department store atmosphere.

The shelves are lined with a wide array of products, ranging from everyday necessities to luxury items. You spot the electronics section where Coco bought the overpriced PlayStation 1. The display showcases various gadgets and devices, including the latest MacBook Air models.

As you observe the scene, you can't help but feel a mix of excitement and unease. The temptation to swipe a MacBook Air lingers in the back of your mind, even as you grapple with the moral implications of such an action.

Coco and her mother are nearby, still engrossed in their shopping spree. Coco seems thrilled with her purchases, while her mother appears nonchalant about the expenses.

The store's exit is visible from where you stand, offering a potential escape route should you decide to go through with the theft. However, the presence of security cameras and vigilant staff members serves as a reminder of the risks involved.
