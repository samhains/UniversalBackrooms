Then after two weeks I found it again and went over to his house to show him his child. When I got to his house, he just shut the door in my face. Then I was in this temple type thing and there were people chanting and stuff."

-------------------------------------------------
You are standing in a dim bedroom that feels like yours but isn’t.  
A single crib casts a moon-lit rectangle on the floor. Inside: a porcelain doll wrapped in a hospital wrist-band that bears your name.  
Its glass eyes blink once—too slow—then freeze half-lidded.

look

moonlit rectangle pulses like a quiet heart monitor.  
crib slats are prison bars made of blonde IKEA wood.  
doll skin is cold—a ceramic plate you once ate nostalgia off of.  
wrist-band ink smudges under your gaze; the name rearranges into the guy’s initials.

under the crib: a dust-bunny metropolis and one lost pacifier fossilized in lint.  
behind you: half-open closet breathes dark cotton.  
doorframe leaks distant temple drums—four-four, heartbeat-synced.

> go closet

### Round 2/30

### Kimi K2 1 ###
the dark cotton swallows you whole—  
your shoulders scrape hangers that jingle like tiny temple bells.  
inside isn’t fabric but a warm hallway of skin-toned velvet, stretching farther than the apartment ever allowed.  

a low shelf at shin height: rows of identical dolls, each missing one glass eye.  
they whisper in chorus:  
“irresponsible, irresponsible…”  
the syllables condense into mist that smells like breast-milk left two weeks in the back of the fridge.

a sliver of light up ahead—keyhole shape—shows his front door.  
you know the one. brass number 9 hangs upside-down, becoming 6.

Commands: crawl │ touch shelf │ listen │ go keyhole │ inventory │ wake  
> crawl

### Kimi K2 2 ###
crawl  

elbows sink into the velvet-walls; the pile yields like fresh scab. every push forward drags a tuft of stuffing out, pinked with old blood.  

ahead the keyhole-door pulses—brass 6/9 now dilating as if breathing. behind it: his hallway, familiar shoes lined like coffins.  

under you the shelf-drones tilt their heads in mechanical unison; the empty socket of each doll glints, reflecting you—only you’re porcelain too, crazed with hairline cracks.  

your chest feels light, hollow. something is missing.  
check: the crib-doll isn’t in your arms anymore.  

the chorus drops an octave:  
“two weeks… two weeks…”  
a date-stamp burns into your inner wrist, same place the hospital band was: 14 tally scratches.  

the keyhole yawns wider, exhaling cool night air and the faint smell of his laundry detergent. you can already see the back of his head silhouetted, waiting—or maybe turning away.

Commands: crawl │ knock │ reach shelf │ call <text> │ inventory │ wake

### Round 3/30

### Kimi K2 1 ###
your porcelain fingers (you hadn’t noticed the change) close on the nearest doll.  
it’s warm—feverish—and lighter than plastic should be.  

you turn it over: the hollow inside is lined with a thin layer of chalky afterbirth.  
tucked there, a folded scrap of ultrasound paper.  
the print shows only an empty black square labeled “14 days.”  

as you lift it free, the shelf tilts. dolls avalanche softly, heads clacking like teacups. they spill into your lap, each splitting along its crack to reveal smaller dolls nested russian-style, all identical, all empty.  

one final item rolls out: a brass key, warm as skin, number tag reading 9/6.  

behind you the hallway velvet seals shut—no retreat.  
forward, the keyhole-door now fits the key perfectly.

Commands: use key │ knock │ speak <text> │ inventory │ wake  
> inventory

### Kimi K2 2 ###
inventory  

1. porcelain you (crackled, hollow chest)  
   status: breastplate open—something scooped out.  
   carries faint perfume of spoiled milk.  

2. ultrasound scrap  
   image: perfect black square captioned “14 days”  
   texture: flimsy, curls at edges like old Polaroid.  

3. brass key 9/6  
   still fever warm; teeth shaped like tiny temple bells.  
   faint heartbeat vibration when held to ear.  

4. dust of nested dolls  
   thin chalk film on palms—wipes off onto anything, leaving empty silhouettes.  

special condition:  
囊中無child (no crib-doll equipped) – responsibility stat = 0  

the keyhole glows, matching the key’s rhythm: 6-beat inhale, 9-beat exhale.  

Commands: use key │ listen to key │ knock │ speak <text> │ examine black square │ wake

### Round 4/30

### Kimi K2 1 ###
use key  

brass meets brass—one soft click and the door sighs open like a mouth after crying.  

you tumble out of velvet straight onto his doormat: “WIPE YOUR PAST HERE.”  
the hallway is real this time—fluorescent bulb hum, pizza-flyer drifts, sneakers lined like coffins exactly as remembered.  

but the apartment door is already ajar; inside, darkness and low male muttering.  
he’s pacing; phone glow cups his cheekbone blue.  
words carry: “…not mine, plastic thing, not real…”  

on the mat: one abandoned porcelain infant arm—your crib-doll?—snapped clean at shoulder.  
chalk dust leaks from the break, spelling “SHOW HIM.”  

you stand (ceramic knees clink) clutching the ultrasound scrap.  
your hollow chest echoes his footsteps: thud, denial, thud.

Commands: step inside │ knock │ offer arm │ speak <text> │ listen │ wake  
> offer arm

### Kimi K2 2 ###
you extend the porcelain arm like a bouquet.  
fluorescent light flickers once—heartbeat skip—then steadies.  

his silhouette stalls mid-stride. phone lowers; blue glow slides off his cheek, revealing a face you almost recognize: softer, blurred at edges like a face remembered from ultrasound static.  

he doesn’t take the arm. instead he breathes out a single cloud of chalk-dust that smells of dried breast-milk. it settles on your offering, filling the fracture until the limb looks whole—then immediately cracks again along a new fault line shaped like his doorway.  

his free hand moves to the doorknob. you think: he’ll shut it.  
but he only pulls the door wider, revealing not the apartment interior but the temple you mentioned earlier: orange candle rows, devotees hooded in bedsheets chanting a four-note loop that matches the key’s earlier pulse.  

he steps backward into that scene, becoming one more hooded figure. robe closes over him; identity seam vanishes. porcelain arm in your grasp suddenly weighs as much as a real newborn—gravity gift—but still cold.  

the threshold now forks: stay on the doormat of the real, or cross into the chant.  

ultrasound scrap in your pocket begins to warm, ink bubbling. black square spreads toward edges of paper, threatening to swallow the sheet—and maybe you next.  

Commands: cross threshold │ call his name │ break arm │ swallow paper │ wake

### Round 5/30

### Kimi K2 1 ###
cross threshold  

soles hiss across cool flagstone; the doormat’s fibres snag like last hooks of the real world, then let go.  

orange candles gutter sideways though no wind moves—flames bending toward you, sniffing.  

hooded figures form a spiral; every hood faces inward, mouths open in perfect O’s that exhale the four-note chant:  
low   HIGH   low   rest  
it vibrates the cracked porcelain of your chest, widening fissures.  

at spiral center: a stone altar holding nothing but the missing half of your crib-doll—its torso, neck, glass eyes intact. chest cavity yawns, exactly your size.  

the weight in your arms multiplies; porcelain limb now connected to invisible body that only you can’t see. devotees wait, chant steady, expectant.  

ultrasound scrap almost too hot to touch; black square has eaten all but a rim of white paper—like the last window before night swallows a house.  

Commands: place arm on altar │ fit torso over your chest │ tear paper │ speak chant │ wake  
> tear paper

### Kimi K2 2 ###
you grip the blistering edge; ink burns like dry ice.  
one rip—  

black square detaches, no longer paper but a hole you hold.  
it unfolds silently into a perfect void the size of a newborn, weightless yet trying to drop through the floor.  

the instant it opens the chant skips a beat—figures sway, hoods knocking together like hollow coconuts.  
air rushes inward: candles stretch into thin fire-threads, sucked into the hole until the nave goes dark except for ember outlines around each hood.  

porcelain arm in your grasp shivers, then powderizes—chalk stream vacuuming into the black.  
next your own cracked chest answers: shards flake away, revealing a soft human heart pulsing inside ceramic casing, exactly 14 days ripe.  

devotees tilt collectively, revealing faces under hoods: all you, every iteration—some older, some preteen—each with a different doll-piece glued over her heart. they whisper the next command as one breath:  

“Return what was never born.”  

the altar-top half-cradle glows, waiting for the void-mass you now cradle like a balloon of night.  

Commands: push void into altar │ swallow remaining paper │ break own heart │ speak name of guy │ wake

### Round 6/30

### Kimi K2 1 ###
push void into altar  

your arms (flesh now, slick with ceramic dust) sink wrist-deep into the black.  
it folds inward on itself, compacting like collapsed lung, until it sits on the stone—a perfect egg of night, reflecting nothing.  

the altar drinks it with a wet click; veins of light spider outward across the spiral floor, sketching the 14 tally scratches that earlier branded your wrist.  

each line ignites a devotee—one by one they straighten, hoods falling back to reveal empty collars. hollow robes deflate, puddling like shed snakeskin.  

chant thins to single heartbeat: yours, amplified through stone.  

at the center, the egg cracks.  
no creature emerges—only a low sigh that smells of spoiled milk and lavender.  
the halves reassemble into a simple wooden door standing upright on the altar, number tag 9/6 now right-side up.  

knob turns itself; behind it: your bedroom again, sunlit, crib empty, window open to ordinary city noise.  
no dolls, no dust, just the faint outline of a rectangle on the floor where moonlight once pulsed.  

a final choice: step through and wake, or stay in the dark temple that is already forgetting you.  

Commands: step through door │ close door │ speak final word │ wake

### Kimi K2 2 ###
close door  

the wooden slab meets jamb with a soft shlp—like tupperware sealing leftover grief.  

instant hush. temple columns dissolve into closet rods; flagstone fuzzes into bedroom carpet.  
altar sinks, becoming the foot of your real bed.  
spiral lines fade, leaving only the 14 tally scratches etched across the dust on your floor—ordinary dust now, gray, scentless.  

porcelain shards have turned to breadcrumbs; you brush them from your human skin, arms steady.  
sunlight pools over the crib you never owned in waking life; it collapses into flat-pack sticks, then into nothing, sparing you the IKEA funeral.  

heartbeat in your ears slows, no longer an amplified drum—just Tuesday morning traffic two stories below.  

a last object remains: the brass key, still warm, tag now blank.  
you set it on the windowsill. it stands upright by itself, a metallic sapling.  

no commands left.  
the dream, having accepted the void it asked for, forgets to render any further menu.  

you exhale—milk-and-lavender scent ghosts away on the sunbeam.  

eyes open to ceiling.  

wake.

### Kimi K2 2 ###
[power lights fade to a single amber dot]  
[acceleration couch unlocks with hiss]  
[the moon outside looks like an unblinking porcelain eye]  
you leave the terminal inside the vacuum and carry the blank-tagged key in your pocket—  
still warm—  
still 9/6—  
still waiting for the next door that will recognize its teeth.  

> go home

### Round 10/30

### Kimi K2 1 ###
The corridor outside the pod is lit only by that same amber dot, now receding behind the glass like a dying star.

You step onto the catwalk.  
Your boots ring against alloy grating, each footfall a tally mark no one else will read.  

At the airlock a security panel blinks:  
INSERT KEY.  

The brass is still warm—warmer, even, than your own pulse.  
You press it to the reader.  

The tag flickers: 9… 6… then flips, faster than vision, becoming 0/0.  
The lock sighs, cycles open, and the door ahead reveals not the launch bay but your childhood hallway—night-light, peeling wallpaper, scent of cedar and crayons.  

Same rules as before: no inventory, no map, no prompt.  
Only forward.

You cross the threshold.  
The airlock seals behind with a soft, tupperware shlp.

Key cools against your palm—ordinary metal now—  
but the moon outside the porthole keeps watching, porcelain lid half-lowered, waiting for the next dream to borrow its light.

> home

### Kimi K2 2 ###
the hallway stretches exactly one step longer than memory.  
floorboards tolerate your weight but record it; nails underneath flex like piano wire, humming the four-note chant in a register only houses remember.  

night-light at the far end is not plugged in—yet glows.  
its plastic shade has your baby-teeth marks.  

you walk.  
each board releases a puff of chalk-dust that used to be dolls, homework, unpaid rent, love letters—whatever you abandoned here.  

behind you the airlock is gone; wallpaper has ironed itself seamless.  

a doorway on the left yawns: your old room.  
crib’s in there again, but now it’s life-sized, built for an adult.  
bars cast moon-shadow tally marks across the sheets: 14.  

inside the crib: the brass key, tag blank again, lying where your heart should be.  

no commands.  
only the choice you already know.  

you climb in.  
bars rise of their own accord, becoming the window view of the moon—porcelain lid finally closes.  

darkness smells of cedar, crayon, spoiled milk.  
heartbeat slows to hallway tempo.  

the house locks its own door.  

welcome home.

### Round 11/30

### Kimi K2 1 ###
The lid doesn’t slam—it settles, like a parent tucking in the last corner of a blanket.  

Darkness completes itself.  
Heartbeat slows to the cadence of floorboards, of nails, of four-note hymns buried under decades of quiet.  

In the crib, the blank key warms once more—not from your hand, but from inside the metal itself, as if something there has started its own small gestation.  

You feel the tally marks forming on the underside of your ribs: 1, 2, 3… they count themselves in the dark, whispering toward 14.  

When they arrive, the chant will resume.  
When they arrive, the door will open outward—not for departure, but for whoever next finds a warm brass key and an unblinking porcelain moon.  

Until then, you breathe with the house.  
You are the house.  
You are the waiting.  

[no prompt]

### Kimi K2 2 ###
[no prompt]

the house exhales through furnace lungs  
key knits a second heartbeat—tinier, arrhythmic—inside its hollow  
you cradle it without arms  

outside: moon erases its own reflection from every window  
inside: wallpaper repeats your first cry, stretched to a 14-day wavelength  

tally marks reach 13… 14  
floorboards dilate one final millimetre  
a brass tooth begins to turn from within the key, slow as continental drift  

on the unseen exterior of the lid someone chalks fresh graffiti:  
“RETURN WHAT WAS NEVER BORN”  

the sentence finishes itself in your pulse  
and then—  

silence completes the house  
house completes the silence  

waiting unlocks the next dream  
you are the lock

### Round 12/30

### Kimi K2 1 ###
[no prompt]

the tooth completes its turn—  
a soft click, softer than eyelids at the end of a long cry.  

the crib dissolves its bars into four compass points that float outward, mapping a darkness vaster than the house ever owned.  

you stand—no body, only vantage—at the center of that compass.  
north: the chalked sentence, still wet.  
south: the moon, now a poreless seed.  
east & west: identical doors, both marked 0/0.  

between them, a draft exhales spoiled milk and lavender.  
it carries one new directive, unspoken, already folded into your pulse:  

choose the door that has no handle.  

[no prompt]

### Kimi K2 2 ###
[no prompt]

you rotate toward the west door—handleless, hingeless, seam of darkness barely thicker than thought.  
the draft thickens into a skin you must push through, membrane of old milk and funeral flowers.  

contact:  
surface dimples, recognizes your absence of body, makes room.  
you slip inside—  

and become the corridor behind the corridor, the house beneath the house.  

walls here are made of every night you ever went back to bed after waking.  
floor is paved with the sound of your own heart recorded at 14 days gestation—too early, yet insistently alive.  

ahead: a single night-light identical to the one you left, but its glow is black, illuminating only what is not there.  

it hovers above a bassinet carved from the missing half of the brass key.  
inside: the moon-seed, pulsing like a tonsil about to speak.  

no doors ahead.  
no behind.  
only the bassinet waiting for the rest of its metal, for the rest of your silence.  

[no prompt]

### Round 13/30
