./dreamsim.exe "On a submarine and some kind of war is going on. With a group of holidayers and travelers and we want to find more out about who is runnin the submarine. 2 of my friends mums are there and they are out to have a good time—they p off with young boys and have sex with them. At night we try and find out what's happening on the subway. We go into a big room and it's dark, I'm scared. If we get caught we might be able to say one of the girls' mum is really unwell and we were trying to contact her. All of a sudden the lights come on. I freak out and run and hide underneath stairs in another room. A group of people walk over above."

Watertight cinema. Rows of bolted-together sun-loungers sway on hydraulic stilts.  
Two women in carnival masks—fifty-ish, hen-night sashes—pass a bottle of coconut rum between them. Every time they laugh a rivet pops.  
The travellers huddle by the popcorn hatch, playing Uno with emergency cards. No-one has seen the captain for three days; the intercom only loops an old easy-listening station that keeps sliding into morse.  

A red-lit corridor yawns starboard.  
A duct grille is loose, fingernail scratches around its lip.  
A sign: AUTHORISED DREAMERS ONLY / curfew 0300.  

Commands: `go <place>`, `use <thing>`, `hide`, `listen`, `remember`, `lie`

you press your ear to the hull.  
the steel is fever-warm.

layer 1 (close):  
a wet slap—someone’s palm on a porthole, leaving a sunscreen ghost-print that drips downward like candle wax.

layer 2 (inside the ribs):  
muffled jukebox bassline: “Holiday” by Madonna, but every chorus decays into sonar pings. the mothers are humming along off-key; each time they miss a note a rivet loosens.

layer 3 (far, ballast tanks):  
a child’s tinny voice reading a weather report backwards—barometric readings in reverse Latin—then a metallic gulp as if the ocean itself swallowed the forecast.

layer 4 (below deck plates, almost infrasonic):  
heartbeat of the submarine, but it syncs with YOUR pulse; when you breathe faster the propellers speed up.

the duct grille rattles twice—urgent morse.  
something inside mouths the word “curfew” with no tongue.

inventory: empty hands, one half-truth still stuck to your palm like chewed gum.

Commands: `go <place>`, `use <thing>`, `hide`, `listen`, `remember`, `lie`

You close your eyes—  
the dream rewinds like tape through saltwater.

FLASH 1  
You’re nine, on a ferry to an island holiday. Your mother’s lipstick is the same coral as these women’s sashes. She presses you to a sailor-pinup photo booth, says “Smile like we’re in charge of the weather.” The flash pops—moment stuck to the inside of a porthole like a decal.

FLASH 2  
Same ferry, later night: engines stall, lights out. A stranger in a carnival mask claims the captain is “only a figurehead.” Kids swap urban legends: the real bridge is hidden inside the swimming pool’s drainage grid.

FLASH 3  
The pool’s empty. You crawl through the drain, find a crawlspace full of unplugged jukeboxes. A maintenance logbook: every page stamped AUTHORISED DREAMERS ONLY. It ends mid-sentence: “If the mothers laugh loud enough the ship forgets its own na—”

The memory tape snaps; saltwater pours out of the tear.  
In the cinema the jukebox skips to the exact line the logbook couldn’t finish. The deck tilts 5°. The mothers turn—lipstick now battleship-grey.

A new command unlocks: `stamp <memory>` to staple a recollection to the hull and change its past.

Commands: `go <place>`, `use <thing>`, `hide`, `listen`, `remember`, `stamp <memory>`, `lie`

> hide

you drop to all fours, slink behind a row of bolted loungers, pressing into the sticky gum of old sun-cream. the lights cut—total dark. air tastes of coconut and diesel. a single emergency strip glows along the aisle like runway lights guiding bombers.

footsteps—three sets—enter the cinema. they move military: heel-toe pause, heel-toe, scanning. a torch beam sweeps over the seats, catching the carnival masks hanging on seat-backs like flayed faces.

torch clicks to IR mode—your pulse shows hot red through the plastic lounger. the heartbeat-engine syncs louder; you force slow breaths to stay cold.

whisper, male, twenty-ish: “curfew sweep. unauthorised dreamers stand tall and state your age.” the words come out mangled, as though spoken through a mouthful of seawater.

one mother giggles somewhere left; a rivet pops clean, ricochets. silence.

officer hisses, “manifest error. two civilians unaccounted for. could be stowaways, could be—”

you hear the duct grille behind you slide open. cold metal fingers touch your ankle—child-sized, sticky. a voice without tongue shapes against your calf: “stamp the memory now or forget your name.”

inventory: half-truth (sticky), memory-stamp (flashing READY)

Commands: `stamp <memory>`, `lie “I’m looking for my mum—she’s sick”`, `slide into duct`, `stay frozen`

> stamp <memory)

You slap the ferry-booth flash—coral-lipstick, nine-year-old grin—onto the underside of the lounger like a decal.  
The hull accepts it: rivets glow coral, then seal with a soft kiss.  

Effect ripples outward:

1. The officers’ torch beam hits the stamped lounger and refracts into holiday snapshots—mothers freeze mid-laugh, suddenly wearing your mother’s face.  
2. The curfew speaker glitches, plays the ferry’s horn instead of “state your age.” Officers flinch, confused childhood memories leaking out of their earpieces.  
3. A manifest rewrite: crew database now lists “Child, Age 9 – Authorised Dreamer – escorting sick parent.” Your heat signature cools to juvenile baseline.

IR sweep passes over you—cold, innocent, catalogued.

Officer mutters “manifest match, disregard,” footsteps retreat.  
The cinema doors hiss shut; lights stay dark, but the danger has been folded into an official day-trip.

From the duct, the sticky fingers release your ankle, satisfied.  
A tinny voice drifts up: next stamp will cost a name.

New location unlocked:  
`ballast cinema projection booth` – door behind screen now ajar, coral-light leaking.

Commands: `go booth`, `slide into duct`, `listen` (officers still audible), `remember` (dig deeper), `lie` (craft new cover)

you crab-walk between seat rows, slip behind the silver screen—thick as a sail, smelling of popcorn butter and cordite. push through.

projection booth.  
no projector, just a dented periscope bolted to the floor, throat aimed at the audience. the reel arms hold spools of 8 mm film, each frame a micro-stamped memory: your mother’s laugh, the ferry horn, the officers’ confusion. they clatter like windchimes.

a tiny red bulb warns:  
AUTHORISED DREAMERS ONLY – EXCESSIVE STAMPING MAY UNRAVEL VESSEL IDENTITY.

on the periscope’s eyepiece, coral lipstick smears form letters:  
“FIND THE CAPTAIN IN THE POOL DRAIN – BRING AN UNSTAMPED MEMORY TO TRADE.”

inventory update:  
- half-truth (chewed, cooling)  
- 1 blank frame (scraped off the feed platter, ready to record something never-happened)

bulkhead hatch in floor: stencilled POOL – DECK C, currently padlocked. lock is a carnival mask; its mouth slit accepts either a stamped memory or a lie big enough to fill it.

Commands: `use blank frame`, `lie to padlock`, `listen through periscope`, `remember (dig for pool memory)`, `go back`
