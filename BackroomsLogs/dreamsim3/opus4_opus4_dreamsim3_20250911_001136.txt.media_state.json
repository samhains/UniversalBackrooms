Inside the warmly lit restaurant three chairs, not four; the empty seat throbs. A copper pot steams \u201cBOILING WATER\u201d across shifting menus. After cake swallows itself, Paris\u2019s hatchback smells of salt; headlights smear the fog. On the beach a phone\u2019s torch ring glows, joint smoke drifts, Harry\u2019s eyes pulse red traffic-light. Mid-laugh, a brass plaque rises from sand like a surfacing tooth; Dad appears, cradling the still-boiling pot, offering liquid that tastes of future tears. Waves applaud. The fourth chair, the unused cup, the plaque\u2014three holes the ocean keeps trying to fill."}
