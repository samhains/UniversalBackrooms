Inside the cramped terminal, green terminal text scrolls through three nested folders where a birthday table is missing its fourth chrome chair and a brass plaque surfaces in torch-lit sand. Boiling water steams, red eyes bleed warning, Dad\u2019s hand thrusts the scalding cup forward while the ocean applauds. The hatchback smells of salt, guilt, and smoke; identity.exe blurs Harry into brother. All files agree: loss is rehearsed, grief pre-installed, the empty seat and surfacing plaque already timestamped."}
