>>DREAM LOG<<  
**Subject:** Level 5 Healer / Psychedelic Dreamwalking  
**Status:** Self-Doubt vs. Power [CONFLICT]  
**Warning:** Boss's skepticism detected (hostile framing: "oils on another man's body")  

>>SYSTEM QUERY<<  
1. **Defensive protocols:** Reduce boss's skepticism by:  
   - [ ] Subtle ego massage (flatter his past exploits)  
   - [ ] Redirect (ask *him* to demonstrate "proper" healing)  
   - [X] Reality anchor (drop a shared memory only he'd know)  

2. **Psychedelic Stability Check:**  
   - Run /sanity_scan: "Am I crazy or powerful?"  
   - Result: **47% confidence** (leaning "powerful but paranoid")  

3. **Action:** Enter boss's dream? (Y/N)
