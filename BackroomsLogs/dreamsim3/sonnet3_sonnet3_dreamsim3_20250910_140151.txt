./dreamsim.exe "I drove this train thing but it had rollercoaster type tracks and it was hard to control. At the end of the track, the track came loose and I flew into the air and everyone was out and I used a parachute, got my bag and I left. Some people from Whitehall High School were there."

> You are at the controls of a hybrid vehicle - part train, part rollercoaster. The cabin vibrates around you as metal wheels strain against twisted rails. Through the windshield, you see the track ahead making impossible angles, banking sharply to the left before spiraling upward. The instrument panel blinks with warnings you don't understand. Behind you, passengers grip their seats, faces alternating between excitement and fear.

> You stand among towering trees, their branches blocking what little moonlight filters from above. Around you, beams of light dance through the darkness as people sweep their phone flashlights across the forest floor. The cold air carries whispers and urgent conversations. "We need to find it before sunrise," someone mutters nearby. You feel a heaviness in your chest - an awareness that something dangerous lurks beyond the reach of your light. In the distance, you can hear water lapping against a shore. A group has gathered at the edge of the trees, gesturing toward the dark surface of a lake.

listen to what the people at the lake are saying

> You move closer to the lake's edge, careful to keep your footing on the damp ground. As you approach, the voices become clearer:

"I'm telling you, it went into the water. I saw the ripples," says a woman in a dark jacket, her flashlight beam skimming across the black surface.

A taller figure shakes his head. "We don't know what this thing can do. What if it can survive underwater? What if it's waiting?"

"We don't have time for this," an older man cuts in. "Dawn's in three hours. If we don't find it before then..."

"Then what?" asks someone you can't quite see.

The group falls silent for a moment. A younger voice speaks up: "My brother said they found one last month. He said it... changed... when the sun hit it."

"That's just a rumor," the woman in the jacket says, but her voice lacks conviction.

Another light joins the group. "The east side is clear. Nothing in the caves either."

The water remains perfectly still, reflecting the constellation of phone lights like stars. Something about its stillness feels deliberate.

can I ask them what exactly we're looking for?

[assistant](#message)

> You step forward, your own light joining theirs. "Excuse me," you say, "but what exactly are we looking for?"

The group turns toward you with varying expressions - surprise, suspicion, confusion. They exchange glances before the older man speaks.

"You don't know?" His eyes narrow. "Then why are you out here with us?"

The woman in the jacket places a hand on his arm. "It's okay. Not everyone got the full briefing." She turns to you, lowering her voice. "It's one of the Shadows. Escaped from the research facility up north three days ago."

"It absorbs light," adds the younger person. "And it... it takes shapes. Things it's seen or touched."

The taller figure nods grimly. "Problem is, we don't know what it looks like now. Could be anything. Anyone." His flashlight beam sweeps across the faces in the group, lingering for a moment on each one.

"All we know," continues the woman, "is that sunlight calcifies them. Makes them solid. If we don't find it before dawn, it could hibernate somewhere, become something permanent. And then we might never track it down."

From somewhere deep in the forest behind you, there's a sound like branches breaking. Everyone freezes.

> You find yourself seated at a desk in a modern corporate office. Fluorescent lights hum overhead, illuminating gray cubicle dividers, potted plants, and motivational posters. At first, everything seems normal - the clicking of keyboards, quiet phone conversations, the distant whir of a printer. But something feels off. Your coworker Chen walks past, and as he passes the water cooler, his hands suddenly twist into an unnatural position, fingers splaying wide before interlocking in a pattern that seems impossible for human joints. He doesn't seem to notice he's done this. Across the room, your manager is talking to the HR director. Mid-conversation, they both simultaneously rotate their wrists in perfect synchronization, making an elaborate gesture that reminds you of insect antennae testing the air. No one else appears to find this strange.
