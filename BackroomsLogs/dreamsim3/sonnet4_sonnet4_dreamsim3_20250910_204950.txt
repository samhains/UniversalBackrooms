```

You are standing in a dimly lit screening room. Folding chairs arranged in loose rows face a projection screen that flickers with pre-show light. The air smells of old carpet and anticipation.

**Current Location: Back of Screening Room**

VISIBLE:
- Dad (sitting middle row, adjusting glasses)  
- Harry (leaning against wall, gesturing)
- Club Host (at front table with three torn bags)
- Small scattered groups of attendees
- Three bags on front table: one cut open, contents spilling
- Your packet of sugar cube jubes (yellows consumed)

AMBIENT:
The host's voice drifts: "...if you haven't seen it in years, the pacing might feel..."
Whispered conversations about money, children, rhetoric
Projection light creates moving shadows on faces

**Available Actions:**
> examine [object/person]
> move [direction/location] 
> listen [to specific conversation]
> interact [with person/object]
> think [about concept]

The Chinatown opening scene begins - someone's face contorts in the flickering light on screen.

What do you do?

Mode: t2i
Prompt: Dim screening room, rows of folding chairs, flickering projector light. Dad and Harry in silhouette. Front table: three torn candy bags spill neon sugar cubesâ€”green, yellow, cut one glistening. A face distorts on the glowing screen, Chinatown begins.
