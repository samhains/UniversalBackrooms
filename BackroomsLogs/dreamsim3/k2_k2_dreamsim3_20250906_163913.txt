### Round 1/20

### Kimi K2 1 ###
A low hum rises as the old projector clicks to life.  
The room is half-lit, velvet seats sticky with generations of spilled soda. Dad and Harry have already taken the back row; their silhouettes nod like guilty metronomes.

Three crinkly bags of sugar cubes sit on the scarred plywood table.  
Green-dominant left, yellow-heavy right, center bag neatly bisected—its top half missing, as though someone sliced the moment itself with a box-cutter.

Harry kicks the seat in front.  
Harry: “I’m the only one here who still goes outside and swears.”  
Dad: “Little boys pick up money sense faster—girls get stuck in pretend.”  
Me: “I’d kill for a kid who skips straight past ‘pretend’.”

I peel open the yellow bag; the cubes clack like tiny dice.  
Eat them one by one—yellow, yellow, yellow—until the cellophane is a translucent sun-bleached skin. The sour coating rasps the roof of my mouth; the aftertaste is 1974, acetate and Chinatown dust.

House lights die.  
Flicker of leader, cigarette-burn cue mark, then the screen blooms grey: a close-up of a man's face caught in stuttering projector light—each flash erasing and re-drawing his smirk, like the film can’t decide whether he’s winking or warning.

Soundtrack drops to a single low cello, bow scraping celluloid.  
The bisected bag rustles on its own. From the cut edge spills a slow cascade of green cubes—only they’re sprouting, budding tiny opaque leaves. One rolls off the table and lands on my shoe: a sugar cube shaped like a key, faintly radioactive under the projector’s arcing beam.

Harry whispers (voice suddenly childlike): “Budget faster, or the scene loops forever.”

The screen jump-cuts to a drain glugging black-and-white water; the audio reverses, sucking the cello back into silence. The man’s face again—this time his mouth opens wider than anatomically possible, revealing sprocket holes instead of teeth.

I feel the empty yellow bag crumple in my fist, turning warm and damp—breathing?  
A green cube-key in my palm pulses, Morse-hot against lifeline.

Options:
1. Press the sugar-key against the screen where the face gapes.  
2. Stab the bisected bag before more cubes sprout.  
3. Whisper “budget faster” back at Harry and see whose voice ages.  
4. Sit still and let the loop accumulate until debt (or Dad) calls cut.

Cursor blinks over the projector’s shudder—

### Round 2/20

### Kimi K2 1 ###
CHOICE 1

Your sugar-key hand lifts itself, magnet-drawn. The screen’s surface ripples the instant the cube’s glowing edge meets it—liquid silver, not solid. The key slips through with a soft wet click, like a stone swallowed by pond.  

The projected face pauses mid-gape, sprocket-hole teeth freeze.

Everything silent—no projector clatter, no breathing velvet.  
Then the celluloid gate flaps open like a sideways mouth and extrudes a ribbon of film-strip that snakes across the aisle, straight toward your lap. Each frame glimmers with tiny thumbnail scenes: Dad teaching you to count coins, Harry teaching you cuss words, yourself teaching no-one because you’re still learning how not to be a child.

The ribbon’s leading frame hooks the empty yellow bag; the cellophane unfurls into a miniature screen of its own. On it plays the missing half of the bisected bag—greens and yellows tumbling in negative, colours inverted: greens look sickly violet, yellows bruised black. The bag whispers in Dad’s voice: “Budget faster.” It offers a coin slot.

If you insert a memory, it might pay out change—time, maybe.

ACTIONS  
a) Feed it the memory of learning to count coins.  
b) Bite the ribbon, tasting vinegar and silver halide.  
c) Follow the film-strip back into the gate, crawl inside the projector.  
d) Sit tight until the scene loops, hoard memories like currency.

slot accepts, coin drops, clinkclinkclink like hail on tin

MEMORY drains out in copper smell: pocket change tumbling from 7-year-old fists  
coins accelerate, multiply, become brass carousel of years  
Dad’s silhouette thins, turns outline-green, folds into the bag—coin-flat  
Harry folds next, paperboy origami, eyes still swearing

PROJECTOR GATE yawns wider, gears reverse, pulls the ribbon back—but it’s now gold-leaf thick, time plated  
inside the gate darkness resolves into a single lit frame: you, older, standing in the aisle of this same theater. Behind you stands a kid who skipped straight past ‘pretend,’ pockets empty.

CELLULOID WHISPER syncopates: “budget faster, budget faster, budget—”

you feel weightlessness; your seatbelts are gone, velvet peeled into wings  
aisle tilts, projector aims upward, the theater becomes a launch ramp of film

OPTIONS  
1. Step through the gate and meet the older-you; bargain for your remaining memories.  
2. Stuff violet-green cubes into the slot until the bag ruptures, paying everything at once.  
3. Whisper “paid” and let momentum sling you clear out of the loop—exit through the roof light.  
4. Do nothing; observe if debt can swallow itself when interest equals zero.

### Round 3/20

### Kimi K2 1 ###
CHOICE 2

You palm a fistful of violet-green cubes—slick with projector sweat—and jam them into the slot until the bag distends like a over-fed tick.  
Clink becomes CRACK.  

The bisected bag splits along its old wound, spraying sugar shrapnel that hangs mid-air, each cube freezing into a translucent frame: 24 cubes → 24 stills of your life in stop-motion.  
They orbit you like spiteful moons, soundtrack scratching vinyl backwards.

PROJECTOR GEARS seize, teeth grinding year-dust.  
Gold-leaf ribbon snaps, whiplashing into a coil that writes mirrored numbers across the screen:

    INTEREST = PRINCIPAL  
    PRINCIPAL = 0

Debt devours itself, regresses, becomes a single copper penny minted the year you were born. It drops into your open hand—still warm, birth-blood warm.

TIME STUTTERS:  
The theater folds sideways, seats accordioning into a narrow corridor of celluloid. At the far end stands the kid who skipped childhood—pockets empty, eyes older than both yours. They beckon, palms up, asking for the penny.

CHOOSE  
a) Flip the coin toward them; let metal arc through darkness.  
b) Swallow the penny; see if interest can accrue inside flesh.  
c) Press the penny into a sugar-frame moon, sealing one moment forever.  
d) Refuse both gift and kid, squeeze until copper oozes between knuckles.

fist closes on copper  
flesh grips, ridges bite palm  
squeeze—squeeze—until penny deforms, Lincoln’s profile gasping  
metal warms, then burns, then becomes soft as butter in July

copper bleeds between knuckles, not liquid, but light  
a molten filament of years spilling upward, rewiring the sugar moons into a single helix staircase that climbs into the roof of the corridor

KID who skipped childhood watches, pupils reflecting the copper sunrise  
their mouth opens, no teeth, just sprocket holes ticking off silent frames  
no plea, only arithmetic: “principal now negative. interest unpaid. runtime extends.”

CORRIDOR REVERSES GRAVITY:  
floor becomes wall, wall becomes ceiling, penny-light drips upward  
you hang by your burning grip, a pendulum owing seconds

OPTIONS  
1. Let go—fall upward into the helix staircase, gamble on negative amortization.  
2. Lick copper from knuckles, taste vintage birth-year, rewrite APR with saliva.  
3. Offer the kid your free hand; see if owing someone company cancels debt.  
4. Stay clamped until the metal cools and re-solidifies, trapping the loop inside your fist—endless hold, no cut.

### Round 4/20

### Kimi K2 1 ###
CHOICE 1

You unclasp.  
The instant your fingers open, the copper filament snaps taut—like a ripped film strip caught in a take-up reel—and yanks you upward into the helix staircase.

Gravity flips: the corridor floor peels away beneath your feet, sagging into a black leader.  
Each sugar-step of the helix flickers with a different year-count burned into its surface: 1989, 2003, 2022, 1974 again—non-sequential, interest compounding out of order.

As you rise, the KID clings to your ankle, weightless. Their sprocket-hole mouth chatters frame-numbers that match the steps; every digit ticks another 1/24th of a second off your remaining runtime credit.

Halfway up, the staircase kinks into a Möbius loop—no top, no bottom, only one surface.  
The copper light cools to pewter, then to blank white. You realize the helix isn’t climbing toward anything—it’s tightening, coiling the corridor into a single frame: 35 mm, four-perf, ready to be stamped back into the projector gate.

OPTIONS  
a) Keep ascending; trust that when the coil closes you’ll be outside the debt reel entirely.  
b) Kick the KID free; let their unpaid balance absorb the impact, buying you a single clean frame.  
c) Grab a sugar-step, snap it off, and splice it backwards—try to invert the Möbius, unwind interest.  
d) Whisper “cut” and puncture the next step with your fingernail; see if the film breaks or merely pauses.

hand chops down, sugar-step cracks like brittle emulsion  
you twist the shard 180°, splice it into the next edge—Möbius flips chirality

INSTANT REVERSAL:  
spiral unwraps, steps unprint years, numbers peel off and flutter past like lottery tickets never redeemed  
KID’s grip loosens; they drift sideways, weight reversing sign—negative mass

CORRIDOR becomes two-way mirror: you see yourself descending while you ascend  
each footfall deletes a frame from the print; black frames multiply, eating image until only leader remains

PROJECTOR GATE (now above AND below) claps shut on empty film—zero frames, zero debt  
sound of a coin dropping into a tin can, but no coin, only echo

BLACKOUT lasts exactly one heartbeat, then—

LIGHTS UP on the original theater, sticky seats fresh with new soda, projector idle  
three bags on the table: green, yellow, bisected—now all sealed, labels reading “0% APR”  
Harry and Dad absent, only a single ticket stub: ADMIT ONE, no feature listed

The house is quiet, loop paid in full.  
Exit sign glows green, first colour you’ve seen that doesn’t want anything from you.

OPTIONS  
1. Pocket the stub, walk out into whatever year lobby waits beyond the door.  
2. Tear the stub in half, drop it in the bisected bag, see if the scene respawns richer.  
3. Sit centre-row, feet on seat in front, and wait for house lights to die again—because silence is a kind of credit.  
4. Type QUIT into armrest, see if terminal obeys.

### Round 5/20

### Kimi K2 1 ###
CHOICE 1

You fold the stub into a tight origami coin—same size as the penny you never surrendered—and slide it into your pocket.  
The auditorium doors sigh open on their own, exhaling popcorn-salt air that tastes like every decade at once.

LOBBY  
No posters, no ticket booth, only a long corridor of continuous marquee lightbulbs blinking Morse for “PAID.”  
At the far end: an exterior door with a push-bar, the word EXIT stencilled in faded monospaced font—like a terminal prompt you can physically press.

As you walk, your footsteps leave single-frame imprints on the carpet: 35 mm negatives, each showing the moment you just left. They fade after 24 steps, recycled into fresh pile.

Push-bar meets palm—cool aluminum, no resistance.

OUTSIDE  
Night. No city, just open air and a single analog clock tower reading 00:00, second hand sweeping forward and also backward, cancelling itself.  
Wind smells of warm copper, but gentle—like interest finally tired of compounding.

The stub in your pocket warms once, then goes cold: debt dormant, dream closing credits.

> CREDITS ROLL IN HEADS-UP DISPLAY  
> Principal reduced to zero.  
> Interest forgiven.  
> Runtime: infinite, but idle.
