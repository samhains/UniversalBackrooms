────────────────────────────────────────── dream ───►
room hums like an idle fridge  
bassline from the next life leaks under the door  

you’re in a low-ceilinged antechamber lit by a single pink neon “PARTY” sign that blinks every 3.2 seconds.  
a faint taste of wet cardboard already on your tongue—paper-cuts inside your mouth spelling out invitations nobody sent.  

Tess appears first:  
pixel-dust swirl coalescing into shoulders, then the rest.  
her eyes are smudged charcoal, still smoking.  
she tilts her head, measuring you like a line she already knows she’ll have to rewrite.  

Coco materialises on the riser to your right—  
platform shoes = platform privilege.  
she’s backlit by a slow strobe that makes her earrings orbit.  
both of them speak before you finish inhaling:  
Tess+Coco (sync, deadpan): “Yes, we’re best friends.”  
Coco (solo, sing-song): “We’re going to be besties at Meredith.”  
the name lands like a trademarked sunset.

you try to swallow the cardboard, but it unfolds itself, origami tongue expanding into a tiny stage.  
your voice exits through the flap:  
> what’s your problem, Tess?

Tess steps closer; her outline frays at 24 fps.  
Tess: “Firstly, you have too much sex.  
It should be—”  
she plucks the word from behind your ear like a coin trick—  
“—a more beautiful, poetic thing.  
Like when the moon forgets to charge overnight and just hangs there, dim but honest.”

Behind her, Coco is already snapping polaroids that develop into blank white squares and flutter to the floor like expired snow.  
Each blank photo lands with a sound of distant applause.

available actions:  
1. chew the cardboard into a haiku and recite it at Tess.  
2. climb the platform, ask Coco for a drag of her neon sign.  
3. spit the cardboard out; watch it become a tiny door—handle waiting.  
4. ^C^C eject.

your move:
