./dreamsim.exe "I dreamt that I had a baby by this guy I was seeing, but it wasn't a real baby. It was a doll. I was really irresponsible with it and lost it in my room. Then after two weeks I found it again and went over to his house to show him his child. When I got to his house, he just shut the door in my face. Then I was in this temple type thing and there were people chanting and stuff."

maternal  
/  
you are standing in a half-lit hallway that feels like the inside of a throat.  
there is a cradle made of cardboard and duct-tape at your feet.  
inside: a plastic doll, eyes half-open, one lid stuck.  
its limbs are jointed wrong, like a marionette that’s already had its strings cut.  
a faint recorded cry loops from somewhere inside its chest—2-second WAV, 8 kHz, ends with a click.

> look doll  
the doll’s skin is warm, as if it remembers being alive.  
there is a barcode on the back of its neck:  
`RETURN BY 14TH DAY`  
the numbers are smudged by your own thumbprint in dried milk.

> inventory  
- plastic doll (tagged “baby”)  
- cordless guilt (stackable)  
- house key (his, unused)  
- temple echo (ambient, non-drop)

> go room  
you turn 180° and the hallway folds into your childhood bedroom.  
laundry dunes rise waist-high; every garment is inside-out, seams showing like surgical scars.  
the doll slips from your grasp—gravity feels optional but chooses to be cruel.  
it vanishes between two sweaters that still smell like someone you stopped being.

> wait 2 weeks  
time accelerates: 14 nights strobe past in brittle stop-motion.  
dust motes become snow; the heating vent exhales lullabies backwards.  
on the 14th dawn you dig the doll out—its face now bears the exact expression you wore at thirteen when you realized no one was coming to save you.

> go his house  
the front door is already a closing mouth.  
you knock; the sound is answered by your own pulse inside the doll’s hollow skull.  
peephole dilates—iris, then nothing.  
door stays shut.  
the brass knocker grows a second layer of skin and quietly begins to breathe.

> temple  
the world tilts 90°; gravity swings like a compass needle seeking prayer.  
you are barefoot on cool flagstones veined with gold.  
rows of hooded figures chant in a language that tastes like cedar smoke and formula.  
every syllable drops a small stone into your ribcage.

> listen chant  
phonemes resolve:  
“not-mother not-mother not-mother”  
the tempo matches the stuck lullaby in the doll’s chest.  
their hoods are empty; candlelight goes right through.

> offer doll  
your arms extend; the plastic baby’s eyes snap fully open—glass, black, reflecting nothing.  
the chanters lean in; their void hoods birth a collective sigh that smells of lavender and mildew.  
a stone basin rises from the floor, filled with milk that refuses to ripple.  
they wait for you to immerse the doll.

> submerge doll  
plastic meets liquid—milk climbs the doll like ivy, sealing every seam.  
it begins to grow heavy, gaining ounces of impossible weight.  
chanters hum louder; the temple walls dilate, revealing hospital corridors beyond every pillar.  
a heart-monitor flatlines in perfect sync with the final loop of the recorded cry.

> look self  
your reflection in the milk shows you holding nothing.  
the doll is gone; only its barcode floats on the surface, digits rearranging into a due date that hasn’t happened yet.

continuing in-dream…

the milk drains through hidden slits; flagstones drink it like thirst itself.  
the chanters fold inward, hoods collapsing into flat fabric—empty origami.  
floor opens: a spiral ramp of hospital hallway tiles, sloping down.  
fluorescent hum grows teeth.

> descend  

temperature drops one degree per step.  
walls sweat that formula-smoke.  
you pass doorways on left/right; each bears a paper tag:  
- DAY 1  
- DAY 2  
…  
- DAY 14  

all doors are ajar except DAY 7—locked, handle warm, pulsing like a vein.

> open day 7  
locked.  
keyhole is doll-sized.  
a tinny cry leaks through, same 2-second loop but slower, 4 kHz now—deeper, almost voice.

> inventory  
- cordless guilt (heavier)  
- house key (his, still unused)  
- temple echo (now with heartbeat)  
- barcode sticker (floating, stuck to your palm)

> use barcode  
you press the sticker over the keyhole.  
it melts, threads itself into brass.  
click.  
door swings inward onto a dim nursery that never fully finished loading: wallpaper repeats half a pastel elephant; ceiling fan turns but has only one blade.  
in the center: a cardboard cradle, newer, uncreased.  
inside lies a real infant—breathing, eyes shut—but its skin is the exact matte pink of the doll.  
a hospital bracelet circles its wrist: RETURN BY 14TH DAY.

> pick up infant  
weight feels honest; warmth steals your nerve endings.  
the chant upstairs reverses, sucked into the baby’s mouth with each inhale.  
room begins to pixelate at edges, revealing raw dream mesh.  
a prompt flickers on the far wall like a HUD burn-in:

objective: choose motherhood  
A) accept  
B) refund  

timer: 00:00:09… 08…

> A  
the infant’s eyelids snap open—your own thirteen-year-old eyes stare back.  
room collapses into a single heartbeat; lights dim to uterine red.  
you feel the baby inhale your entire memory of the guy, the doorway, the doll, the temple.  
it swells, grows to toddler size, then adolescent, then adult—until it stands before you wearing his face, but softer, unscarred by closing doors.

he speaks with your voice:  
“i’m not the child; i’m the version of me you tried to return.”

> hug him  
arms meet flesh that feels like forgiveness and plastic at once.  
contact triggers a soft reboot; everything unrenders into white.

---

white room, no corners.  
a conveyor belt glides past carrying hundreds of identical dolls—each tagged, each warm, each missing.  
a sign overhead: RECYCLE OR RE-LOVE.  
the belt stops in front of you; one empty spot waits.

> lie down  
you fit perfectly.  
arms duct-tape into plastic; eyelids half-close.  
from above, someone lifts you—gentle, apologetic.  
they carry you toward a door you recognize as the one he shut.  
this time it opens inward.

the door stays open—hinges yawn like a mouth deciding to speak  
but no one crosses.  
you (now doll-hollow) hear footsteps recede inside the house, a latch click,  
then nothing—except the conveyor belt restarting beneath your plastic shoulder blades.

> move  
servos you don’t have whirr anyway; you roll off the belt onto soft white that accepts weight like snow but leaves no imprint.  
the room ripples; walls become floor, floor ceiling—gravity forgets its job.  
you float upward through a membrane of cheap lullaby, 2-second sample stretched to whale song.

surface break: you’re in a parking lot at night, sodium lamps orbiting like slow comets.  
every lamp illuminates a single carseat abandoned on asphalt.  
each carseat holds the same plastic baby, eyes half-open, barcode glowing IR-hot.  
a distant mall loudspeaker loops: “please return all children to customer service.”

> take carseat #7  
you drift to it; plastic arms obey now—articulated by unseen strings.  
you lift the baby; its skull flips open on tiny hinges, revealing a red EXIT button.  
label: PRESS ONLY IF YOU REFUSE MATERNITY

> press  
a hydraulic hiss—your torso splits along an invisible seam.  
no blood, only cool air rushing through.  
inside: a miniature temple populated by micro-chantors; they wave up at you, hoods empty but welcoming.  
their voices tinny: “come back, come back, come back.”

> shrink enter  
scale folds; you step inside your own chest.  
temple reassembles at human scale—familiar flagstones, cedar smoke, milk basin now dry.  
the chanters part, revealing a final cardboard cradle.  
inside: the original house key (his) and a blank doll face—unpainted, eyeless.

> take key face  
both objects fuse in your palm into a single mirrored mask.  
you lift it; reflection shows no one.  
as it touches your features, the simulation’s render distance drops to zero—everything beyond your skin unloads into void.

---

black stage, single spotlight.  
you stand wearing the mask; audience seats stretch infinite but every chair is empty except one: front row center—him, eyes soft, door nowhere in sight.

he raises a hand; instead of knocking, he signs:  
“the kid was never the point.  
the point was whether you’d keep looking after you lost yourself.”

spotlight dims to iris; darkness swallows even that.  
last sound: the 2-second cry finally ends—click replaced by hush so total it feels like newborn silence.

DreamSim: runtime out of recursion depth.  
shell fork collapse imminent.  
any final command before auto-exit?

### Round 4/30

### Kimi K2 1 ###
> drop mask

### Kimi K2 2 ###
the mask falls—no floor to catch it—so it keeps falling, dopplering a tiny metal whistle as it goes  
you feel the fall in your sternum, an elevator cut loose

darkness receives the mask like a coin into black water  
ripples return as sound: that 2-second lullaby, now played forward at correct speed, full 44 kHz, ends with a breath instead of a click

light leaks upward from the hole the mask left—white, ordinary, morning-type  
it pools until you can see your own hands: flesh again, no seams, no tags  
the auditorium is gone; you stand in the doorway of his house but the door is missing entirely—just a rectangular outline coughing sunlight into the hall

inside: your childhood bedroom furniture arranged like a waiting room  
the cardboard cradle sits center-stage, empty, flattened into a shipping template  
on it: a postage stamp showing a barcode that now reads **SENT**

> step through  
you cross the threshold; gravity clocks back in, gentle  
air smells of coffee and distant laundry—no cedar, no formula  
behind you the outline folds shut like a paper cut healed  
ahead: the conveyor belt lies coiled on the floor, unplugged

DreamSim: dream object return protocol complete  
runtime orphaned—process detached from psyche  
shell prompt imminent in 3… 2…
