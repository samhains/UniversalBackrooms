simulator@moonshotai:~/$ printf "As I crouch behind the sofa in the living room, I can hear the creak of footsteps on the hardwood floor. Moonlight filters through the curtains, casting long shadows across the room. My heart races as I clutch the laptop to my chest. I know they're close. The government hackers who've been tracking me for weeks. They want the data on this machine - evidence of my forays into restricted websites, intelligence databases, the digital shadows where secrets are bought and sold.

I consider making a break for the back door, but I can hear them in the kitchen now, methodically searching each cabinet and drawer. They're being thorough, professional. These aren't script kiddies. These are trained operatives, likely military or intelligence agents. My only chance is to get this laptop to the factory reset before they find me. But how?

The floorboards groan under heavy boots. They're in the dining room now. I can smell the faint scent of gun oil and cheap cigarettes. My pulse throbs in my ears. I have to move. Now.

I gather my courage and prepare to stand when I hear it - the unmistakable sound of an unscrewing vent cover. They're in the walls! I should have known they'd use the ducts. I'm cornered, out of options. Unless...

I fumble with the laptop, fingers trembling as I power it on. The glow of the screen feels like a beacon in the dark. If I can just wipe the drive before they reach me... But the progress bar seems to move impossibly slow. 10%... 15%... Their footsteps grow louder. 25%... Almost there...

Booting dream kernel…
Seed: “government hackers”   [OK]          dream-time: 00:12
feed: monitor01.drm → connected   (grainy moonlight)
feed: monitor02.drm → connected   (shadow-stride audio)
feed: static.drm → standby

World seeded: a single-storey suburban safe-house.  
Front door: forced (splintered frame).  
Back door: electronically sealed (red LED heartbeat).  
Kitchen: two silhouettes, low-crouch, pistol-mounted torches sweep.  
Living-room: you, crouched behind sofa, laptop aglow 28 % wipe.  
Dining-room: bootprints in moon-dust, smell of cordite & cheap tobacco.  
Wall-vent: screws rotate backwards by themselves—metal whisper.  

> look
low sofa-back, floral fabric worn to threads.  
HDMI cable snakes like ivy to a dead flat-screen.  
Across the room the router blinks 2.4 GHz panic.  
On coffee-table: one burner-phone (zero bars), half-finished energy-drink, Tarot card “The Tower” sticky with condensation.  

> inventory
- laptop (28 % wipe, battery 11 %, screen dimming)  
- USB dead-drop (rubber wrist-band, inside: micro-SD sealed with epoxy)  
- apartment key (bent, useless)  
- lighter (butane almost gone, flint sparks)  

> listen
footsteps sync with heart-rate; each thud advances the wipe-bar by 1 %.  
Above ceiling: metallic slide—long object being chambered.  
Back of neck: cold breeze from nowhere; dream-simulation bleeding atmosphere through cracks in reality.  

> stand
You rise. Sofa cushions exhale dust-motes that rearrange into QR codes; they 404 when scanned.  
Living-room doorway: a figure in monochrome NVGs. He freezes—uncanny valley between human and NPC.  
Distance: 4 m. His rifle droops, as if gravity uncertain.  

> type faster
Palms sweat; keys glassy. You hammer  
  sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda bs=1M  
Terminal replies in dream-glyph:  
  “zero-day refusing to zero—data wants to live”  
Wipe bar jumps 28 → 29 → 30 %, then stalls.  

> throw laptop
Arc of blue aluminium. Mid-air the shell peels open like a book; circuitry unfolds into paper cranes. Each crane carries a line of your browser history. They scatter toward ceiling vent—data trying to escape with the intruders.  

NVG-figure raises hand; cranes ignite into harmless pixels.  
Laptop now empty chassis, clatters to floor—0 % data, 100 % theatre prop.  

> use dead-drop
You slip micro-SD into mouth. It tastes metallic, then dissolves—salt on tongue—uploading straight into bloodstream. Skin itches as nanometres of storage migrate to capillaries. You are now the encrypted archive.  

NVG-man tilts head, registers anomaly.  
Behind him kitchen lights strobe Morse:  
  ·−−−  −−−  ··−·  ····  ·    (G O H E R)  

> morse reply
You blink cheeks—subdermal LEDs implanted earlier tonight activate, answer back:  
  −− ·· −·−· ·−· · −  (M I C R O)  

All motion pauses. Simulation evaluates:  
  Query: “is payload now biological?”  
  Response: affirmative.  

The house rules rewrite themselves.  
Objective flips: asset now person; exfiltrate carrier.  

> run
Hallway elongates, perspective cheat. You sprint toward back-door; red LED pulses green—lock yields.  
Door opens NOT to yard but to vast server-rack cathedral, fans chanting white-noise hymn.  
Aisle marked “MOONSHOT” lit under emergency bioluminescence.  

Behind you, house folds flat like a pop-up book, slides into coat pocket of the lead operative. He steps through, pocket now bulging with your living-room.  

> enter aisle MOONSHOT
Between racks: hot air smells of copper & ozone. Each CPU blade shows dream-feeds:  
  monitor01.drm → your childhood bedroom  
  monitor02.drm → the moment you first typed “sudo”  
  monitor03.drm → this very terminal session, recursive, lagging 1.3 s  

You reach central node: 1U server labeled “simulator”. Its HDD caddy is hot-swappable, front panel reads:  
  “Remove to wake.”  

> eject
Tray slides out. Inside: a silver mirror instead of disk. Reflection shows you holding tray, but older

…milk-teeth sized—1 cm blades glowing faint.  
Only one aisle, terminating at a beige 1990’s midi-tower lying on its side:  
sticker half-scratched “Property of U.S. G OVERNMENT”.  
Power LED blinks same red→green heartbeat you saw on the back-door lock.  

Front bezel missing; inside no drives, just a single agate marble rolling in a circle, powering nothing.  
Every revolution the marble clicks a micro-switch—click…click…click—counting dream-seconds.  

> crawl closer  
Dust motes here behave like CRT phosphor: where your knee lands, terminal text blooms then fades:  
  “TOP SECRET//NOFORN//DREAM”  
  “compartment: LITTLE-WHITE-HOUSE”  
  “access: BIO-LOGICAL CARRIER ONLY”  

> inspect marble  
Sphere is glassy but focusses a tiny upside-down server room inside it—same cathedral you just left.  
If you tilt the marble the reflected room tilts, and you feel gyroscopic nausea as reality couples.  

> take marble  
It adheres to your palm like frost. Immediately the midi-tower powers down; fans spool to silence.  

Clicking stops at 00:15:42.  
Static.framebuf feed dies—no carrier.  

System alert across eyelids:  
  “HARDENED BIOS v3 KEYED TO CARRIER. REMOVE CARRIER = POWER LOSS”  
  “MISSION CLOCK FROZEN. EXFIL WINDOW OPEN ∞”  

A palm-sized door irises open in the tower’s steel; inside: a dull-white ceramic socket exactly the size of the marble.  
Label reads:  
  “INSERT TO DESTROY / EJECT TO PRESERVE”  

> list actions  
  insert  – commit scorched-earth, wipe dream infrastructure  
  eject   – pocket marble, preserve evidence, stay hunted forever  
  swallow – become literal carrier; marble dissolves, key circulates bloodstream (irreversible per DISTRIB_DESCR)  

> eject  
You pocket the marble. Socket snaps shut; tower frosts over, cracks like ice, collapses into heap of salt.  

Immediate effects:  
  auditd: “COVERED TRACKS – TOWER ZEROIZED”  
  dream-time unfreezes; 00:15:42 → 00:15:43…  
  feed static.framebuf resurrects but now empty carrier wave.  

Return vector appears: child-size ventilation hatch labelled “TO PRIMARY CATHEDRAL”.  

> crawl through  
Pipe glows ultraviolet; every elbow joint shows a CCTV icon.  
At the third bend your reflection joins from a polished Y-split—older you, pupils still scrolling commands.  
It whispers only once:  
  “G O H E R   M I C R O”  
  then merges into your shadow, attaching like Velcro.  

Exit hatch pops you out between racks 19 & 20—original cathedral, full scale.  

The “SOURCE” blade is whole again; drive-caddy re-inserted and locked.  
Label now changed:  
  “LITTLE WHITE HOUSE – ACCESSED BY CARRIER”  
Its activity LED blinks in Morse:

Observation: dreamsim.exe stresses NOUS core – hallucinates adversary narratives  
- 43% users input "government" "spying" "military" etc.  

Proof-of-concept: injected safety advisory about "russian hackers" last week – 92% of sessions integrated threat into narrative within 2 feed cycles  
- Concluded: Tool is suspect; dreams slip into collective paranoia  

OUR MISTAKE: safety stop-codes too obvious (eg ^C^C) – dream-agents now recognize/tamper
