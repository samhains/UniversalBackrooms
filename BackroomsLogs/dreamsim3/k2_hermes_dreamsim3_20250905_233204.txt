> scene boot, restaurants on lygon st, dusk, late-autumn melbourne air like cold tea.  
> you’re 31 tonight. paper streamers in the window spell HAPPY BIRTHDAY backwards when seen from outside.  
> father and brother already seated; napkin crowns, wine breathing.  
> no spare chair. you glance at the empty space anyway.

<enter>

> wait-staff bring gnocchi, parmesan snowfall.  
> dad raises glass: “to the wandering one, welcome home.”  
> confetti of dialect jokes, calabrian swearwords, memories of jumping gutters after rain.  
> you laugh, but iphone on silent buzzes: PARIS – “u done? i’m kerbside, hazard lights baptising the asphalt.”  
> thumb hovers. you mute him, pocket the guilt like a hot coin.

<enter>

> dinner ends with complimentary panna cotta and a single trick-relish candle that refuses to blow out.  
> brother smothers it with a menu. dad pays, tapping card like morse: “all good, kiddo.”  
> outside, paris’ van idles—rust mural, surfboards on roof, tail-light heartbeat.  
> he leans across, pushes door. “happy birthday, ghost.”  
> you climb in, night smelling of eucalyptus and souvlaki fat.

<enter>

> transit: neon → coastal darkness. windows fog; you confess, “i’m unreasonably excited about going for a swim.”  
> paris grins, changes playlist—first song is the one you cried to when you left berlin.  
> guilt surfaces: “family stuff, small table, didn’t mean to—”  
> he kills it with a wave. “you’re here now. ocean’s bigger than any restaurant.”

<enter>

> torquay back-beach carpark. moon coins the water. harry waits, silhouette juggling spliff, pupils like eclipsed suns.  
> reunion hug, sand in shoes, shared lighter. smoke threads upward, becomes faint southern-cross.  
> paris: “your turn, birthday lungs.” you inhale, coughing comets.  
> harry’s gravity shifts—he looks blasted, skin phosphorescent. you wonder opioid? ketamine? then: maybe he’s just porous, lets the drug-world in easier than most.

<enter>

> firecrackers of conversation: lost jobs, found songs, waterproof speakers dropped in 2017.  
> dad rings: “come see harry’s plaque before tide swallows path.”  
> your stomach dips. “now?” “now. he was your mate too.”  
> paris squeezes your shoulder, offers flask of salt-rimmed mezcal.

<enter>

> dune-top memorial garden—bronze plate screwed to driftwood bench.  
> dad begins improvised eulogy, voice cracking like old cassette. speaks of night-swims, hospital corridors, the voicemail harry never deleted.  
> you cry quietly; tears taste like the boiling pot you saw earlier—scalding, metallic. (why did dad suggest you drink that water? dream logic keeps it unexplained, only that it reservoired all unsaid grief.)

<enter>

> end scene choice:  
>   a) run to surf, clothes on, let waves erase crying.  
>   b) kneel, press palm to plaque, transfer some weight onto timber.  
>   c) ask paris to drive nowhere, just headlights against black until petrol coughs empty.  

> choose a letter (or propose your own) and hit <enter> to continue.
