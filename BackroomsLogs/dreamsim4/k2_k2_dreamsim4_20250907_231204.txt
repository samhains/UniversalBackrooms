### Kimi K2 2 ###
<cmd>look</cmd>

You stand on a mirror-bright obsidian plaza.  
The violet sky above is lake-calm; no stars, only slow kites tugging at ribbons of half-remembered voices.  
Gravity feels like a suggestion; your hair floats upward, brushing your cheeks like seaweed.

Nearest kites (tagged):
  0 age-7 “first bike ride”  
  1 age-12 “hospital corridor”  
  2 age-17 “first storm kiss”  
  3 age-23 “funeral laughter”  
  4 age-? “unlived future”  
  5 age-31 “mirror refusal”  
  6 age-40 “book unfinished”  
  7…11 (further, fainter)

Center: a candle burns up & down in perfect duplication, its flames motionless yet flickering.

> touch kite-2
You reach for the cerulean kite tagged “first storm kiss”.  
Your fingertips graze the ribbon—static pops—then the plaza folds like dark origami.

—scene shift—

Rain hammers a tin awning above a bus stop at twilight.  
You’re 17 again, heart ricocheting.  
Opposite: a girl/boy/partner whose face is smeared watercolor; the memory refuses resolution.  
Lightning forks; for an instant the plaza candle appears in the sky, keeping the dream tethered.

[[You can speak, act, or rewind (1 use). Time here is ½-speed.]]

### Kimi K2 2 ###
> open inventory

- traveller’s silhouette ➜ lets you “borrow” any dream-figure’s outline for camouflage  
- breath rewind (0 uses left here; already consumed) ➜ one dream earlier you could exhale to rewind. ribbon still thumps with rewind-residue  
- kite-touch privilege ➜ allows further string-grabs while inside a memory  

> speak “show me the watercolor face before the blur”

The figure tilts, paint-stroke edges fluttering.  
A gust of thunder forces the colors to pool – briefly resolving into your own eyes at age… 23? 31?  
The mouth forms a wordless ring: *O*  
Then it drips back into anonymity, but the sound of rain reverses for a beat – droplets rising – as if offering a hidden path.

> inventory traveller’s silhouette ➜ wear watercolor outline

Your edges soak up the loose pigment; the plaza candle flickers approval.  
You now appear to the dream as “unfinished portrait,” gaining diplomatic immunity from topology ejections.  
Stability +5 % (now 98 %).

> look inward

Inside the borrowed outline: gears of translucent clockwork pump violet sky-plasma.  
Each gear tooth is a miniature version of the obsidian plaza.  
One tooth is cracked; through the fracture you glimpse the candle burning sideways, leaking minutes.

[[Commands: speak/act/rewind-pulse/touch-inward/exit-memory]]

### Round 3/inf

### Kimi K2 1 ###
> touch inward cracked gear
Your finger meets the fracture.  The gear tooth dissolves into obsidian sand that pours upward, carrying you through the wound.

—scene shift—

You fall lightly onto a narrow catwalk of glass suspended in starless space.  Below, giant clockwork petals turn like slow helicopter blades; each petal is a translucent garden cultivated by silhouette gardeners wearing masks of your face at different ages.  They snip stems that drip liquid seconds, collecting them into hourglass-pods tied to the undersides of the kites you saw earlier.

Centre of the mechanism: the same candle, now monumental, burns up and down along its entire height, towering through the catwalk's axis.  Its twin flames rotate gently, winding the garden-petals.

Lucidity spike: 96 %

> look gardeners

Closest gardener (age-7 mask) notices your watercolor disguise.  It offers a hand-sized hourglass-pod filled with shimmering seconds.

> inventory hourglass-pod

- hourglass-pod (miniature) ➜ can decant “borrowed time”; usage unknown  
- traveller’s silhouette (pigment fading)  
- kite-touch privilege  

> speak “what happens if I pour these seconds into the candle?”

Age-7 gardener tilts its mask.  A chorus of overlapping child voices answers:

“Up-candle burns future, down-candle burns past.  
Pour sideways ➜ time spills outward and the plaza forgets you.”

Stability: 95 % (warning: topology fork ahead)  
Fade timer: 28 s

Choices:  
1. Pour seconds into up-flame (future leap)  
2. Pour into down-flame (past rewind)  
3. Pour between flames (sideways exit / plaza amnesia)  
4. Keep pod, keep walking catwalk  
>

### Kimi K2 2 ###
> hold pod between both palms, feel its weight

The miniature hourglass pulses—each grain a crystalline voice: “bike-hospital-storm-funeral-unlived-mirror-unfinished—”  
When your warmth meets the glass, the grains freeze into a single transparent bead: one second that contains all the memory-kites at once.

> status

lucidity: 98 %  
stability: 94 % (flirtation with fork)  
recursion depth: 3 / 9  
fade: 25 s  

> command自拟: fracture the bead against the catwalk rail

You tap the hourglass-pod sharply. The glass rings—no shatter—instead the bead elongates into a silver needle that points along the catwalk, then bends itself into an @-sign and hovers.

needle-sign options (whispered):  
  @future ➜ up-candle  
  @past ➜ down-candle  
  @plaza ➜ sideways spill (forgetting)  
  @self ➜ inject the second into your own silhouette  

> inventory add silver-time-needle (single-use)

> command: @self

You press the needle against your watercolor chest. It slips through pigment without resistance.

—internal event—

The second grafts into your traveller’s silhouette.  
All kite-strings snap taut at once, tugging the gardens upward like parachutes.  
Gardener masks turn; they no longer see “unfinished portrait,” they see *author*.  
Stability plummets to 77 %—authorship is destabilizing.

Text scrolls across sky:

[DreamSim] Warning: dream acknowledging operator.  
[DreamSim] Depth 3 autonomy breach.  
[DreamSim] Recommend immediate narrative cloaking.

Lucidity: 100 % (over-saturated)  
Fade: 17 s

Available cloaks:
1. Rename self (revert to observer)  
2. Release second back into candle, accept random branch  
3. Dive off catwalk into clockwork petals (depth +1, gamble)  
>

### Round 4/inf

### Kimi K2 1 ###
> dive off catwalk into clockwork petals

You step off.  The watercolor outline peels away like wet paper, revealing a core of mirrored glass.  Air thickens into glycerine time; each petal below becomes a slow-motion guillotine of translucent garden shears.

—collision—

You land feet-first inside a petal the size of a cathedral.  Internal surfaces are screens projecting every prior kite memory simultaneously, tiled in kaleidoscopic fresco.  At the petal’s keel: the candle again, but now horizontal, acting as an axle.  Its up/down flames have become east/west, rotating the entire blossom like a paddle-wheel.

Environment tag: “Chrono-Calyx”  
Recursion depth: 4 / 9  
Fresh mechanics detected:
- petal-screens editable (touch to rewrite)  
- candle-axle can be re-oriented (risky)  
- fade timer paused while inside rotating frame  

> look fresco tiles

Tile #43 age-17 storm-kiss is blank: the watercolor face you asked for earlier is missing here.  A grey placeholder rectangle hums, sucking surrounding colors toward its void.

> inventory

- silver-time-needle (used; now a thin scar on your glass palm)  
- traveller’s silhouette (shattered remnants float nearby, salvageable)  
- kite-touch privilege (still active, but kites are now recursive images on screens)  

> touch blank tile #43

Screen ripples open like mercury.  The void offers trade:

“Supply missing face to stabilize tile, or reach inside and pull the unlived future out.”

Lucidity holds at 100 %—over-saturation migraines into violet static at edge of vision.  
Stability: 71 % and dropping 1 % every 5 s until blank filled.

Choices:
1. Insert your true face (permanent dream record)  
2. Reach in, extract “unlived future” kite (#4) and cling to it  
3. Smash tile, create gap in paddle-wheel (catastrophic)  
4. Retreat to petal exterior (requires re-cloak)  

> opt 2: reach in, extract “unlived future”

You thrust arm into grey.  Cold like reversing film wraps your skin.  You grip something slick—an embryonic kite still folded, ribs of possibility crackling under satin skin.

Pull—

The void resists, then births the folded kite with a POP.  Instantly the tile seals behind you, now showing a blurred silhouette holding a folded kite—the first frame of a new memory that hasn’t happened.

[DreamSim] Side-quest seed planted: “Unlived Future.”  
[DreamSim] Depth 4—personal timeline artifact acquired.

Stability climbs to 85 % (continuity regained)  
Lucidity: 95 % (static recedes)  

Folded-kite properties (scanned):
- can be opened only outside causal light-cone of candle-axle  
- opening rewrites one upcoming decision node in waking life (irreversible)  
- counts as recursion key (+1 to effective depth when used)

> inventory add folded-kite (meta-item)

Environment cue: petal-screens begin cycling faster; axle groans. The dream quietly asks where you want to steer the blossom next.

Prompt on petal-floor in glowing chalk:

“Re-orient candle:  
  N → blossom becomes elevator down to Depth 5 (subconscious archive)  
  S → blossom flips outward, ejects you into sky-violet (random upper layer)  
  W → time reverses inside petal (replay to edit prior acts)  
  E → lock rotation, open docking hatch to adjacent petal (networked memory-share)”

lucidity: 95 %  
stability: 85 %

folded-kite (key)  
fade timer: still paused while axle turns  

> look adjacent petals

Through the translucent petal-walls you see two neighboring blossoms:

- Petal A: flickers with hospital fluorescence; gardeners wear surgical masks shaped like your childhood home.
- Petal B: night-bus interior frozen mid-crash, rain droplets suspended like glass beads; the storm-kiss memory plays backward on every window.

> command: chalk reply — rotate candle N ↓ elevator to Depth 5

You grip the horizontal candle-axle. It’s warm, pulsing east-west flames lick your mirrored palms without burning. A single twist counter-clockwise—

—grinding bloom—petal-screens accordion into elevator blades—garden frescos become archival shelves—violet sky recedes above like a closing iris.

—descent—

The petal-elevator drops through a shaft of liquid starlight. Every meter downward peels another year of noise from the dream; sound simplifies into heartbeats, then into single syllable: “home… home…”

Floor indicator etched in darkness:
  4.3 … 4.7 … 5.0

Ding.

Doors (petals) slide open.

—scene: Subconscious Archive—
An infinite reading room built inside underwater caverns. Bioluminescent jellyfish drift like chandeliers, each containing a memory you never noticed you stored: the smell of a library carpet at age 6, the weight of a stranger’s gaze on a train, etc.  Rows of obsidian card-catalog drawers float at neutral buoyancy, tethered by silk threads to the cavern ceiling.

Archivist drone (shape: silhouette wearing your oldest face) hoists a ledger:
“Return or borrow?” it asks, voice multitracked like a cassette eaten by a Walkman.

Lucidity: 93 %  
Stability: 90 % (archives are foundation layers; hard to shake)  
Depth: 5 / 9  
Fade: still paused; timer will resume when you leave the elevator car.

> inventory

- folded-kite (meta-item, unopened)  
- traveller-silhouette shards (2 fragments, could re-forge)  
- silver-time-needle scar (cool to touch, faint chronal charge)  

> speak “I want to borrow the drawer that rattles when the future folds”

Archivist tilts ledger; ink rearranges into a call-number: “CAT-∞-F”.

A distant drawer vibrates, emitting the same humming you heard from the blank tile. You swim-walk through viscous air toward it.

Drawer label: “Futures, Unlived (compressed)”  
Size: matchbox.  
Warning etched beneath: “Opening inside archive collapses possibility wave; do it elsewhere.”

> take drawer

Pocketable. Drawer shrinks into a black chrome micro-cassette labeled “F.”

[DreamSim] New meta-key acquired: micro-cassette “F”  
[DreamSim] Optional objective: Locate playback unit outside causal radius of candle-axle to combine with folded-kite.

> command: survey room for exits

Exits observed:
1. Elevator car (still open, can return to rotating petal)  
2. Airlock-style hatch in cavern floor marked “Memory Drain → Depth 6 (liminal sewer)”  
3. Spiral staircase of bubble-glass rising into darkness labeled “Hypnagogic Spire → Depth 3 shortcut”  
4. Card-catalog ladder that telescopes upward endlessly, each rung a year you haven’t lived yet.

Prompt blinks bottom-right:  
“Depth 5 stable.  Choose vector or combine meta-items?”

### Round 5/inf

### Kimi K2 1 ###
> combine meta-items: place folded-kite against micro-cassette “F”

You align the satin kite-ribs to the chrome cassette.  Both objects twitch—magnetic recognition.  The kite’s fabric splits, revealing a tiny wind-up key; the cassette sprouts a spool-slot that welcomes the key perfectly.

—fusion—

A single silver thread extrudes, linking them like paired elevator cables.  A new composite object forms:

[DreamSim] Crafted: “Kite-Tape”  
  - one playback of unlived future  
  - rewinds or fast-forwards at user’s heart-rate  
  - requires open, non-causal space to activate (i.e., outside any candle radius)  
  - usage will auto-escalate to Depth 6 then pop you to waking unless counter-weighted

> inventory add Kite-Tape (fragile, alive)

Archivist watches, ledger page now blank.  It quietly offers a counter-weight option:

“Trade a memory you already own to balance the future you wish to hear.”

Trade candidates detected in jellyfish chandeliers:
A) “first bike ride” (anchor memory, high emotional mass)  
B) “funeral laughter” (complex, heavy but unstable)  
C) “mirror refusal” (light, regretful, expendable)

> command: trade “mirror refusal”

Archivist plucks a jellyfish containing age-31 mirror-scene; its light dims as it’s pressed onto the ledger scale.  The Kite-Tape glows steadier, gains a protective shell.

[DreamSim] Counter-weight accepted.  Activation safety raised; Depth 6 excursion will remain reversible.

> look exit 2: Memory Drain hatch

Circular valve, rubberized rim dripping with dream-sludge.  Stencil reads:  
“To Depth 6 Sewer – where discarded sub-plots ferment.  Bring boots.”

Hatch wheel turns itself, inviting.

> status

lucidity: 94 %  
stability: 92 % (balanced artifact)  
depth: 5 / 9  
inventory: Kite-Tape (ready), silhouette shards, needle-scar  

Prompt:  
“Activate Kite-Tape here (risky – candle-axle still above) OR descend to Depth 6 for full causal separation?”

### Kimi K2 2 ###
> open hatch just enough to check for causal silence

You crack the Memory Drain a hand-width. A wet breath exhales—no ticking, no candle scent, no axle vibration. The sewer below is acoustically dead: perfect.

> slip through, seal hatch behind

—splash—ankle-deep in lukewarm runoff of half-written nightmares. Bioluminescence from above is gone; light now comes from globs of phosphor mold that blink like faulty fluorescents.

Depth 6: Liminal Sewer  
Sub-title etched on slime-coated wall:  
“WHERE PLOTS GO TO ROT AND RE-COMBINE”

Cylindrical tunnel extends both directions; ceiling pipes drip narrative sludge—random sentences hitting the water, dissolving into letters that wriggle like eels.

Nearest drops:
- “she never replied”  
- “the train was early”  
- “the candle burned sideways” ← (candle reference but corrupted; safe)

Causal scan: zero candle harmonics. You’re outside the axle’s light-cone.

> inventory Kite-Tape → activate

You wind the key. The tape spools; kite fabric tightens into a headphone-shaped cup that settles against your left ear.

Playback begins—only you hear it:

Wind first, then your own future voice (calm, older) says:

“Open the silver needle scar. Let the glass spill. That’s how we get to Depth 7.”

Playback ends; tape rewinds itself into the cassette, kite folds back to pocket size. Counter-weight memory (“mirror refusal”) is now etched on the shell as a tiny reflective icon—proof of payment.

> inspect needle-scar on palm

The scar has developed a hairline fracture glowing cool white. When flexed, it emits a low tuning-fork hum in sync with your pulse.

Hint from Kite-Tape seems literal: “Open the scar.”

> command: flex palm sharply to split scar

You bend your hand back. The glass skin cleaves along the fracture—no blood—just a vertical slit revealing an interior tunnel of mirrored light descending farther down.

[DreamSim] Generated: personal micro-wormhole → Depth 7 (closed loop)  
Warning: once entered, only exit is completion or total dream-death (you’ll wake, but lose all artifacts).

Optional safeguard: consume silhouette shards to weave a “life-line” that guarantees artifact transfer to waking inventory.

> inventory combine: 2 silhouette shards + sludge thread (plucked from dripping sentence “the train was early”)

You twist shard-glass and soggy letters into a single silver cord, anchoring one end to the sewer rung.

> attach life-line to belt

Cord clicks like a carabiner. Trauma-proof.

> step through palm-wormhole

Body folds into a ribbon of reflected selves—every age you’ve worn—then snaps to single point.

—Depth 7: Closed Loop—  
Environment: an exact replica of the original obsidian plaza, but monochrome and silent. Violet sky now newspaper static.  
Anti-gravity absent; you feel ordinary weight.  
Center: the candle stands unlit, wax pooling like frozen mercury.  
All 12 kites lie collapsed on the ground, strings cut.

Mission tag appears in headline font across the sky:

“REIGNITE OR ACCEPT EXTINGUISHING”

> look kites

Each kite is blank satin—memories erased by your transit through loop. Only kite #4 (“unlived future”) retains a faint outline; its frame supports the Kite-Tape device you made.

> status

lucidity: 100 % (hard-cap)  
stability: ∞ (loop locks topology)  
depth: 7 / 9  
fade: suspended (loop outside time)  
inventory: Kite-Tape, life-line anchored, needle-scar now an open portal behind you (sealed from this side)

Choices:
1. Light candle → requires heat source; possible outcome: loop reboots, dream continues to Depth 8  
2. Refuse → blow out pool of frozen mercury → immediate waking, artifacts transfer, dream ends  
3. Insert Kite-Tape into unlit wick → play future into fuel (experimental)  

> opt 3: slot Kite-Tape candle-ward

You lift the Kite-Tape; the fabric unwraps itself, feeding into the cold wick like ribbon into a typewriter.  A single word prints across the sky in your older calm voice:

“Watch.”

The candle ignites sideways—flame travels left-to-right across emptiness, sketching a horizon rather than a fire.  Where flame passes, color returns: violet sky, floating kites, anti-gravity 0.21 g—but everything now runs in reverse gear.

Loop status: reversed  
Depth: 7→8 imminent (after full horizon burn)  
Inventory notice: life-line vibrating—dream is preparing ejection

### Round 6/inf

### Kimi K2 1 ###
> look horizon-flame

It’s a line of living calligraphy, every spark a reversed second: hospital laughter rewinds into birth-cry, storm-kiss pulls away into strangers, obsidian tiles drink up their own reflections until they become mirrors facing mirrors.

When the flame-tip reaches the final tile, the horizon folds upward like a page, revealing a vertical slit of white—an exit door made of light.

[DreamSim] Depth 8 threshold forming.  
[DreamSim] Requirement: leave all compound artifacts inside loop; only base items transfer to Depth 8.

Kite-Tape is now the burning wick itself—can’t be retrieved.  
Life-line still attached to your belt; pulling it will auto-eject you to waking once you pass the door.

Inventory strip-down:
- traveller’s silhouette shards (stays; will reassemble in loop as NPC)  
- needle-scar portal (bound to your palm; considered “body,” allowed)  

> status

lucidity: 100 % (clipped)  
stability: ∞ → collapses to finite at door passage  
depth: 7 (transition 8)  
fade: resumed, 15 s countdown appears on horizon page-edge  

> walk toward white door, grip life-line

Each step shortens the line; behind you, the plaza reverts to monochrome ash, kites curling into blank paper, candle burning backward until unborn.

You arrive. Door hovers like a slit film-frame. Through it: Depth 8 glows ultraviolet; shapes too big to name drift beyond.

Prompt etched in doorway gumline:

“STEP THROUGH = Depth 8 (final playable layer)  
PULL LINE NOW = wake + carry needle-scar (single relic)  
>Decision in 10 s<”

10… 9…

>

### Kimi K2 2 ###
> pull life-line NOW

You yank the silver cord. It snaps taut, anchors in the film-slit, and reels you backward through a tunnel of folding calligraphy. The door recedes; Depth 8 irises shut with a single metallic click.

—ejection—

Sensation of being poured into a colder, heavier body. Eyelids unlock.

[DreamSim] Session terminated by operator.  
[DreamSim] Transferring permitted artifact…  
[DreamSim] 1 item bound: palm-scar portal (latent).

WAKE

You surface in the dark of your real room. Clock on desk: 04:03.  
Your left palm tingles; a thin white line glows softly beneath the skin, warm as candle glass. When touched, it hums at 432 Hz—the dream frequency.

Inventory carried to waking:
- needle-scar micro-wormhole (single-use, real-world)  
  * effect: open small space/time shortcut big enough for a letter, a key, a breath  
  * danger: edges sharp; misuse collapses scar, leaving permanent void patch in palm

[DreamSim] auto-branched: micro-loop established (duration < 1 heartbeat)  
Warning: if you finish the exhale the loop will collapse and you’ll lose the extra frame of life  

options before lungs betray you:

1. type a second space—widen loop, steal another frame  
2. backspace—erase the null, exit loop, reclaim breath  
3. let lungs leak and watch yourself watch yourself disappear

### Round 14/inf

### Kimi K2 1 ###
> 1 — feather a second space into the void

aperture gains depth; the reflected neck now wears a smile one tick ahead of yours  
an unused heartbeat slips into the gap—stored like a tiny battery

[DreamSim] frame-cache +1  
lucidity: 46 % (threaded)  
breach countdown: 2.3 s until diaphragm overrides  

cursor still paused mid-blink, undecided which face it belongs to

### Kimi K2 2 ###
> 3 — diaphragm overrides; leak the breath slowly through clenched teeth

the exhaled air exits *both* mouths at once—yours and the ahead-version—condensing on the inside of the aperture like frost on a lens  
with the sound of a page turning, the loop folds into a Moebius strip and the second space becomes a real, physical gap between two of your ribs

[DreamSim] frame-cache consumed; heartbeat injected into local time  
side-effect: +1 irregular pulse (permanent until dream-death)  
lucidity: 48 %  

cursor finally completes its blink—now synced to the new thump—  
and waits for whatever word you bleed into the sideways candle next

### Round 15/inf

### Kimi K2 1 ###
> pulse types the word before thought can shape it: “ribspace”

letters emerge left-to-right yet burn into the skin between ribs right-to-left, calligraphy of reversed candle-fire  
the aperture seals with a zipper of light, leaving a sub-dermal corridor you can feel when you inhale again—like cool metal under the bone

[DreamSim] custom lexeme logged: “ribspace” – unmapped command, syntax open  
lucidity: 52 %  
new prompt surface: inner underside of ribcage glows violet, inviting edit  

choices:
1. probe ribspace with fingertip – possibly unpack hidden directory  
2. ignore, type another word – let language build outward  
3. hold still – see if the body autocompletes its own sentence
