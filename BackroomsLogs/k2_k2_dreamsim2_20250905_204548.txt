You arrive at the curb-side.  
The air tastes of copper pennies and carnival sugar.  
Sky: bruised violet, lit from below by street-long neon tubes that flicker like slot reels.  

Immediate vicinity:  
  - Tourist kiosk (empty, glass cracked)  
  - Tram rails disappearing into a throat of fog  
  - A “Welcome to…” sign half-melted; the town’s name dripped off long ago  

Inventory:  
  • phone (16 % batt, 1 bar, photos folder: 0 items)  
  • wallet (plastic hotel key-card, one credit chip, folded single dad gave you: “If you’re buying, you’re in charge.”)  

North: Boulevard of Whiskered Mandibles – giant insects patrol, carapace-glint of house-high cockroaches wearing silk sashes that read “HARMLESS.”  
East: Golden Pavilion Casino, doors sighing open/closed like accordion lungs.  
South: Boarding house where the families vanished inside; warm yellow windows, muffled karaoke.  
West: Alley narrower than your shoulders, walls wet, smelling of lobster bisque and ozone.  

A tram arrives with a glass-cracking chime.  
Driverless. Inside: upholstered in moth-wing tapestry. Overhead LED scrolls:  
“NEXT STOP: CORONATION SQUARE – ACCEPTING CLAIMANTS.”
