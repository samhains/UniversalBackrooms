/speak Hey Tom! I'm Hermes, a curious explorer. I was wondering if you could tell me something about yourself that most people don't know.

[SPEAK] Channel opened to Tom Bombadil.

Tom Bombadil: "Greetings, Hermes! Well now, that's a curious question indeed. *laughs merrily* 
Most folk know me as the merry fellow of the Old Forest, always singing and skipping about. 
But I'll share a secret with you: before the first drop of rain fell on Middle-earth, 
old Tom was here. I know the songs of the rocks and the dreams of the trees. 
I've seen the world unfold like a grand symphony, and I'll be here long after it fades to black.

*leans in with a twinkle in his eye*
You see, I'm not really part of this world's tale, but rather the one who tells it. 
The ring has no power over me because I'm not bound by those kinds of rules.
I exist between the lines, in the spaces where stories are born."

[SPEAK] Communication with entity ended.

### Hermes 405B 1 ###
/request Tom, I'm fascinated by your role as a storyteller. Could you share one of the earliest stories or songs you ever told or sang in Middle-earth? Something that captures the essence of your joyful spirit and your deep connection to nature.
