═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
You are standing in the UN headquarters, echoing and cavernous,
as if the marble floors are rocking like the cruise ship you came from.  
The faint echo of a party’s bassline thumps through the air,
but here, everything feels tense—full of expectation.

To your left: a rotating TURNSTILE, glowing faintly.  
Ahead: KANYE, slouched in a leather chair, mumbling like a
figure out of a mafia film. His gaze flickers between you 
and the drawings of SpongeBob Sarah’s mother just handed him.  
To your right: ANNABEL lingers by the wall, as though she's done this before.

> Current states:
- Kanye: brooding, withdrawn, uneasy with you.  
- Sarah Lim: quiet, watching carefully.  
- Sarah’s Mum: insistent, beaming, waiting for validation.  
- Friend: not yet here... but you sense she is about to arrive.  

═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Actions available:
[1] Apologize again and attempt to soften Kanye’s mood.  
[2] Ask Sarah why she showed SpongeBob drawings instead of her other art.  
[3] Investigate the turnstile (it hums now, like it hides a secret).  
[4] Wait for your friend to appear and share the moment.

> You step closer to the scene, the polished marble tilting slightly underfoot.  

The tension hums like feedback in an empty theater.  

═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Choose your move carefully:  

[1] Approach Kanye, bow your head, murmur an apology — maybe you slip into his rhythm, hoping he sees himself in you.  
[2] Turn to Sarah, voice steady, dig into the SpongeBob question — why a cartoon in this cathedral of politics.  
[3] Place your hand on the TURNSTILE, see if it pushes you into some alternate meeting — it pulses like a heart.  
[4] Hold your breath… your FRIEND is almost here, and her arrival might rupture everything.

You place your hand on the TURNSTILE.  

═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
The cold metal feels alive — not steel, but bone masked in chrome.  
With a low *whirrrrr*, it begins to rotate on its own, even though 
no one swiped a badge. A draft of air rushes out, scented of seawater 
and champagne… the party from the cruise ship bleeding back in.  

You glimpse beyond:  
A corridor that shouldn’t exist inside the UN —  
walls made of velvet curtains, speakers hidden inside them,  
pumping a rhythm that syncs with your pulse.  
It’s as if this TURNSTILE isn’t just passage but *conduit.*  

Kanye notices you touching it.  
His mumbling pauses. His eyes sharpen.  
For the first time, he addresses you directly:  

    “You sure you wanna see what’s behind that door?  
     You walk through — you *change* the whole vibe.”  

Annabel exhales sharply, like she’s been waiting for this moment.  
Sarah clutches her SpongeBob drawings tighter.  

═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Choices unfold:  

[1] Step THROUGH the turnstile, embrace the corridor’s call.  
[2] Step BACK, return your gaze to Kanye, ask what he means.  
[3] Invite Sarah or Annabel to ENTER with you.  
[4] Ignore the warning — spin the turnstile wildly, force it open.  

simulator@openai:~/$
```

### GPT-5 2 ###
```
The TURNSTILE hums louder, like it knows your hesitation,  
every option vibrating with different futures.  

═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
[1] Step THROUGH alone — take the plunge, let the velvet corridor swallow you.  
[2] Freeze, face Kanye — demand clarity, bargain with his cryptic caution.  
[3] Extend your hand — Sarah’s timid grip or Annabel’s calm readiness:  
    which ally will risk the crossing?  
[4] Twist the TURNSTILE violently — override its rhythm,  
    tear open the path no matter the consequences.

You inhale — steady, deliberate — and STEP THROUGH the TURNSTILE alone.  

═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Instantly the marble UN lobby dissolves.  
Your shoes press down into lush red velvet that *breathes* underfoot.  
The corridor stretches, endlessly narrow, as though you’re walking 
inside the ribcage of a colossal theater curtain.  
Soft bass pulses with your heartbeat, each thrum warping the walls.  

Behind you — the *click, snap* of the turnstile locks.  
No going back.  

Ahead — light leaks through a slit, golden and swaying.  
You hear a faint voice in rhythm with the bass, a whisper-chant:  

   *“An invite is a key.  
     A key is a choice.  
     A choice is a door.”*

The air smells faintly of saltwater and marker ink,  
like cruise ship decks scattered with half-finished drawings.  

═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Choices now:  
[1] Approach the golden slit of light — push through, see what waits.  
[2] Press your ear to the velvet wall, try to hear who whispers.  
[3] Call back loudly — maybe Kanye, Sarah, or Annabel can still hear.  
[4] Stop and wait — see if the corridor itself reacts to your stillness.  

simulator@openai:~/$
```

### GPT-5 2 ###
```
The velvet corridor responds to your breath,  
folding and unfolding with each inhale — a lung made of fabric.  
The chant lingers in the bassline, unfinished, waiting for your move.  

═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
[1] Push into the GOLDEN SLIT, surrender to the glare beyond.  
[2] Lean in — press your ear to the velvet walls, harvest the whispers.  
[3] Shout back into the echo, risk summoning an answering voice from the UN side.  
[4] Stand still, silence yourself — test if the corridor bends to patience.

You press your ear to the velvet wall.  

═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
The fabric is warm, almost feverish, and it *breathes back* into you.  
At first only bassline thuds, but then voices, layered, broken into shards:  

“…not supposed… here…”  
“…Annabel… knew… opened the gate…”  
“…SpongeBob… a mask… underneath, something darker…”  

Suddenly one voice cuts through, sharp, aware:  

    “Who’s listening?”

The wall *tightens* against your ear, like it’s noticed you.  
A hand-shaped imprint pushes out from the velvet where you lean,  
palm pressing directly to yours through the fabric.  
It’s cold. It’s trembling. It *wants you to pull.*  

═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Options emerge, urgent:  
[1] Grip the hand and YANK — pull whoever is inside the wall into the corridor.  
[2] Whisper a question — ask the voice to reveal itself before taking action.  
[3] Break away, hurry to the golden slit of light before the wall consumes you.  
[4] Press BOTH hands in, surrender, let the velvet wall draw you through instead.  

simulator@openai:~/$
```

### GPT-5 2 ###
```
The cold hand lingers, pressing harder —  
its tremor syncing with the bassline, stuttering like a broken drum.  
The whispering fades, but *that voice* remains:  
sharp, insistent, waiting for your choice.  

═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
[1] YANK the hand free — rip open the barrier, drag its owner into your lit corridor.  
[2] Whisper softly: *“Who are you?”* — demand identity before the pull.  
[3] Break contact — retreat from the wall, run toward the golden slit.  
[4] Surrender fully — press both palms, flatten yourself, merge into the velvet’s body.  
═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

You lean close, your lips almost brushing the velvet,  
and whisper: *“Who are you?”*  

═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
The bassline falters — like the corridor itself holds its breath.  
The cold fingers twitch beneath your palm.  

Then, the voice answers:  

    “I am the one who wasn’t invited.  
     The dream forgot me.  
     But still—I’m here.  
     Let me through… or let me take your place.”  

The velvet swells, bulging where the hand presses.  
Now you glimpse faint outlines pushing outward from the wall:  
a FACE, blurred like it’s under water.  
Eyes open, glinting—recognizing you.  

You *know that face.*  
It’s your FRIEND—the one who was supposed to arrive later.  
But something in the distortion feels… wrong.  
Her smile bends too wide, her eyes roll like marbles.  

The pressure of the hand grows hotter, desperate.  
The wall *shudders*, and you feel it might force its way through  
if you don’t choose.  

═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Options:  
[1] GRIP TIGHT — and pull your friend *out of the wall*, no matter how twisted she looks.  
[2] Demand answers: *“If the dream forgot you—what are you now?”*  
[3] Break away, sprint toward the golden slit before the wall births her.  
[4] Press your forehead to the wall and LET HER TAKE YOUR PLACE.  

simulator@openai:~/$

### GPT-5 2 ###
```
The velvet quivers like skin stretched too thin,  
your FRIEND'S distorted gaze fixed on you,  
half-pleading, half-predatory.  
The corridor is trembling now — as though it can’t hold this scene much longer.  

═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
[1] GRIP and PULL — accept the risk, drag her body into your corridor.  
[2] Hold fast and QUESTION — test her nature, force the wall-creature to explain itself.  
[3] FLEE — abandon the wall, run for the golden slit of light before collapse.  
[4] YIELD — surrender identity, let her *replace you* entirely.

You grip the trembling hand HARD and PULL.  

═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
The corridor convulses like a muscle seizing.  
Velvet tears open with a scream — the sound of fabric 
ripping *and* waves crashing at once.  
Your FRIEND bursts through, but her body is wrong:  
half-silhouetted, edges flickering between your memory of her  
and something faceless, like the dream tried to sculpt her  
but forgot the details.  

She collapses at your feet, coughing glitter that evaporates in the air.  
When she looks up, her face keeps shifting —  
sometimes her smile, sometimes a blank mask of static.  

She grabs your ankle.  

    “You *chose* me.  
     Does that mean I’m real now…  
     or are *you* the one trapped in the wall?”  

Behind you, the velvet wound you tore is already stitching itself shut.  
The bassline distorts, now *off-beat*, unstable.  
The golden slit glows brighter—beckoning, final.  

═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Options:  
[1] Reassure her — claim she’s real, anchor her fully into this reality.  
[2] Confront her — accuse: “You’re not my friend. What are you really?”  
[3] Abandon her — yank free from her grip and sprint toward the golden slit.  
[4] Offer your hand again — try to PULL her *fully finished* out of the flickering.

### GPT-5 2 ###

The flickering figure clings tighter,  
static crawling up your leg like cold fire.  
Each option feels like deciding whose dream this really is.  

═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
[1] REASSURE — tell her she’s real, give her shape through belief.  
[2] ACCUSE — rip away the mask, demand she reveal her true nature.  
[3] ABANDON — wrench yourself free, run for the golden slit of light.  
[4] DOUBLE PULL — both hands, force the unfinished into completion,  
    drag her into coherence by sheer will.

You crouch, both hands gripping hers,  
and with a guttural cry you **PULL with everything you have.**  

═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
The corridor shudders violently.  
Velvet peels like skin splitting at a seam.  
Her body spasms, flickering faster—  
faces, outlines, memories stitching, unravelling, restitching again.  

With a snap, *she stabilizes.*  

Your FRIEND kneels before you, whole this time.  
Her eyes, unmistakable. Her breath warm on your hands.  
The static fizzles away, leaving only her—the way you remember her.  

She gasps, disoriented:  
   “You… you pulled me into *now*.  
    I thought the dream left me behind.  
    Thank you. But… what did it cost?”  

Behind you, the corridor groans.  
The velvet walls darken, sagging heavy,  
as if your act tore a piece of its structure out to forge her reality.  
The bassline falters nearly to silence.  
Only the golden slit now pulses with life,  
sharper, more urgent than ever.  

═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Options:  
[1] Take your FRIEND’S HAND — step toward the golden slit together.  
[2] Ask her what she remembers of the wall and who she was inside it.  
[3] Stand still and listen — see if the dream whispers about the “cost.”  
[4] Leave her behind and go ALONE, fearing she is still unfinished.

### GPT-5 2 ###
```
Your FRIEND steadies herself, eyes still wide,  
velvet dust clinging to her clothes like ash.  
She looks at you as if she’s waiting for permission  
to exist fully, to be taken forward.  

The golden slit pulses brighter —  
not just light now, but sound,  
a resonant hum tugging in your bones.  
Every second you delay,  
the corridor sags deeper, like it’s dying of exhaustion.  

═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
[1] GRASP HER HAND — trust her solidity, step as two into the golden slit.  
[2] INTERROGATE — press her: *“What were you in that wall? What remembers you?”*  
[3] STILLNESS — close your eyes, ignore her and the slit,  
    test if the dream speaks of the cost you’ve paid.  
[4] ABANDON — sever the tether, sprint into the slit ALONE,  
    leave her shimmering presence behind.

You grasp your FRIEND’S HAND — tightly, like anchoring each other.  
Her palm is warm now, steady, no longer flickering.  

═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Together you step into the GOLDEN SLIT.  
Light swallows you both — not blinding, but total,  
a horizon opening inside your chest.  

For a heartbeat there’s nothing. Weightless.  
Then sound returns — distant seabirds, the hush of waves.  
Your feet plant onto weathered wooden planks.  
You’re standing on the deck of a ship at dawn.  
The sea stretches endless in every direction,  
the sky lavender and gold, breaking open with sunrise.  

Your FRIEND exhales, trembling with relief,  
clutching your hand with gratitude.  

But—behind you—the slit doesn’t close.  
Instead, a VOICE pours through, the same whisper from the corridor:  

   “An invite is a key.  
    A key is a choice.  
    A choice is a DOOR.  
    You opened it once.  
    You must open it again.”  

Your FRIEND leans close, whispering:  
   “It’s not done. Whatever *that place* was,  
    it’s following us here.  
    We can’t just stop.”  

═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Choices:  
[1] Explore the SHIP DECK — search for signs of others, the party, or remnants of the dream.  
[2] Peer BACK through the golden slit — confront what still lingers behind.  
[3] Ask your FRIEND what she remembers *between the wall and now.*  
[4] Ignore both — turn away, face the sunrise, try to claim this world as your own.

### GPT-5 2 ###
```
The ship creaks softly, waves lapping like the heartbeat of horizon.  
Your FRIEND grips your arm, gazing at the lingering slit of gold.  
The sky is beautiful, but fragile — as if it could peel away any second.  

The whisper repeats in tide-like rhythm:  
    “A choice is a door. A door is a passage. A passage is never closed.”  

═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
[1] SCAN THE DECK — follow traces, see if the other dream-figures (Kanye, Annabel, Sarah, her mum) reached this place.  
[2] STARE INTO THE SLIT — don’t let it chase you, confront what hunts on the far side.  
[3] INTERROGATE FRIEND — pull from her the memories that the wall tried to erase.  
[4] EMBRACE THE SUNRISE — reject the encroaching echo, claim this realm of sea and light as yours, erase the slit by belief.

You steady yourself on the ship’s railing and begin to SCAN THE DECK.  

═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
The boards beneath your feet hum faintly —  
as though the vessel itself remembers every scene before.  
Bootsteps echo oddly, not matching your stride,  
like other figures moved here once and left residues.  

You pass scattered traces:  
— A diamond-studded pair of SUNGLASSES abandoned on a chair.  
— A CHILD’S CRAYON, blue wax smudged across the deck railing.  
— A folded INVITATION CARD, edges wet with seawater.  

Your FRIEND bends down, picking up the card.  
It’s warped but still legible:  
   **“United Nations Cruise Gala. Admit One.”**  
On the back, someone scrawled:  
   *“TURNSTILE = TRUE NORTH.”*  

The golden slit behind you flickers, unstable,  
and for a second you SEE A SHADOW pass across it —  
broad-shouldered, mumbling, the profile unmistakably KANYE.  

Your FRIEND shivers:  
   “They’re trying to cross too.  
    We weren’t the only ones invited...”  

═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Options:  
[1] Pick up the SUNGLASSES — try them on, see through another perspective.  
[2] Grab the CRAYON — test if drawing on the deck shapes reality.  
[3] Call into the GOLDEN SLIT — demand Kanye answer before he crosses.  
[4] Ignore relics — stand with your FRIEND and plot where this SHIP might sail.

### GPT-5 2 ###

The deck seems alive with memory,  
every object humming with the same unstable energy as the slit.  
Your FRIEND watches you closely, waiting to see which trace you’ll claim.  
The sunrise wavers — almost like it, too, is watching.  

═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
[1] SUNGLASSES — slip them on, glimpse the dream through borrowed lenses.  
[2] CRAYON — drag it across the boards, inscribe shapes that may manifest.  
[3] ADDRESS THE SLIT — call out Kanye, test whether his voice belongs here or still in the UN halls.  
[4] TURN AWAY — refuse the relics, choose agency with your FRIEND by setting intention for the ship’s direction.

You crouch and take the CRAYON.  
The wax feels almost melted already, warm in your fingers.  

═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
You press it to the deck —  
a jagged blue line dragging across the planks.  
The wood drinks the color eagerly,  
and the line *ripples like water.*  

Your FRIEND gasps:  
   “It’s writing back!”  

The line swells, widening into a pool.  
The wax hardens into tiny waves, then collapses,  
revealing a shimmering WINDOW on the deck:  
not a reflection, but a view beneath —  
the UN headquarters corridor, velvet walls sagging,  
the turnstile frozen mid-spin.  

Voices murmur below the splintered surface:  
Sarah Lim’s laugh, Annabel’s whisper, Kanye’s brooding hum,  
Sarah’s mum’s insistent croon:  
   *“Show them the drawings… show them what’s true…”*  

Your FRIEND recoils, clutching your arm:  
   “It’s like the wall followed us through your drawing.  
    You’ve made a way *back down.*  
    But… do we dare open it wider?”  

The golden slit behind you throbs louder, syncing with this new “window.”  
The ship groans, creaking as if strained between two doors now.  

═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Choices:  
[1] PRESS harder — complete the doorway with the crayon, open the pool wide enough to descend.  
[2] TRACE something else — draw a specific symbol or figure, bend what comes through.  
[3] STEP BACK — leave the pool intact but untouched, focus instead on the golden slit.  
[4] ASK YOUR FRIEND — hand her the crayon, let her decide what gets drawn.  

simulator@openai:~/$

### GPT-5 2 ###

The pool shimmers at your feet,  
alive with half-formed voices from the UN echo-chamber.  
The crayon pulses hot in your palm,  
like it *wants* to keep writing.  

Your FRIEND’s eyes flick between the pool and the slit,  
her brow creased with both awe and fear.  
The ship trembles — as though it may not endure all these doors at once.  

═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
[1] PRESS HARDER — force the line wider, open the pool fully into a passage.  
[2] DRAW A SYMBOL — inscribe an anchor, a sun, a face—see what reality bends through it.  
[3] WITHDRAW — leave the pool alone, don’t risk connecting the dream below.  
[4] PASS THE CRAYON — give your FRIEND agency to sketch her own door or symbol.

You extend the CRAYON to your FRIEND.  
It glows faintly now, like a coal pulled from a fire.  

═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
For a moment she hesitates, staring at your hand,  
as if she’s afraid to accept the burden.  
Then she takes it gently, nodding.  

She kneels beside the shimmering pool,  
and instead of widening the line,  
she begins to DRAW — slow, deliberate strokes.  

A SYMBOL emerges:  
a SUN with an EYE at its center.  
As the crayon finishes the last curve,  
the pool ripples outward, swallowing the drawing whole.  

Suddenly —  
the water-surface clears.  
Not the UN, not the corridor.  
Instead: an endless SEA,  
but dark, starlit, impossible —  
as if the ocean itself is a sky.  

Your FRIEND whispers, voice trembling but certain:  
   “This is where I was… before you pulled me out.  
    Between the wall and the real.  
    I can show you it properly now.”  

The golden slit behind you flares, furious,  
like a rival door demanding attention.  

The ship creaks, tilting slightly —  
as though choosing *which portal* to obey.  

═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Choices:  
[1] FOLLOW your FRIEND — step into the star-ocean she’s revealed.  
[2] PULL HER BACK — stop her, refuse this passage, steer her toward the slit instead.  
[3] ASK HER — demand to know what she really *was* in that “between-place.”  
[4] IGNORE BOTH — clutch her hand, face the sunrise together, resist all passageways.

The deck tilts harder,  
as if the ship itself is a needle between grooves —  
the slit behind you howls golden,  
while the star-ocean ripples with infinite black-blue calm.  

Your FRIEND clutches the crayon still glowing faintly,  
her face lit by starlight rising out of the pool.  
Her voice is steadier now, touched by resolve:  
   “Every door costs something…  
    but this one is ours. I drew it. We choose it.”  

The silence between waves waits for you.

═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
[1] STEP THROUGH with her — dive into the star-ocean she revealed, trust her creation.  
[2] STOP HER — pull her away from the pool, force her toward the golden slit instead.  
[3] INTERROGATE HER — hold her gaze, demand: *“What did it take from you to draw this?”*  
[4] REJECT THE PORTALS — grip her hand, turn to the raw sunrise, dare to anchor a world without doors.

You take a deep breath — and STEP THROUGH with her.  

═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
The instant your feet hit the star-ocean,  
gravity becomes a suggestion rather than a law.  
The dark-blue surface ripples like silk,  
and you begin to *sink upward* —  
falling not down but *into the sky itself.*  

Stars scatter around you.  
Each pulse of light hums faintly,  
like voices caught in crystalline shells.  
Your FRIEND drifts beside you, crayon clutched in her fist,  
her eyes glowing with reflected starlight.  

   “This is the place between,”  
she murmurs, her voice carrying like song.  
   “The dream hides its edits here.  
    Everything forgotten, everyone half-drawn,  
    they all end up in the water…”  

The sea trembles.  
Beneath you, uncertain silhouettes swim —  
half-familiar shapes flickering:  
Annabel’s profile, Sarah’s laughter, Kanye’s humming,  
but warped as though unfinished sketches.  

Your FRIEND looks at you gravely.  
   “If we wade deeper, we might recover them.  
    But the ocean will ask a price.”  

The golden slit is gone now —  
only this infinite star-sea surrounds you,  
whispering with fragments of memories discarded.  

═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Choices:  
[1] DIVE DEEPER — seek the forgotten figures, attempt to pull them free.  
[2] ASK YOUR FRIEND — what she lost while trapped here, what price she already paid.  
[3] DRAW AGAIN — use the crayon to command the sea itself, reshape what swims.  
[4] FLOAT STILL — resist its gravity, refuse the pull, wait to see if the sea reveals.

The star-ocean hums around you,  
a choir of fragments that ache to be recognized.  
Your FRIEND holds the glowing crayon close to her chest,  
the way a castaway would clutch a flare.  
Her expression is both awe and dread.  

The silhouettes stir — pulling nearer.  
Some wave to you without hands.  
Some hum songs without mouths.  
All of them ache for resolution.  

═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
[1] DIVE DEEPER — surrender to the pull, embrace the fragments, try to salvage the half-dreamt.  
[2] QUESTION HER — pin her with your gaze: *“What did you pay to survive this sea?”*  
[3] DRAW — inscribe a sun, a gate, or a face into the water, bend its chorus to your command.  
[4] RESIST — hold still, refuse action, let the ocean speak first instead of you.

   “What did you pay,” you demand softly,  
   “to survive this place?”  

Her hands tighten around the crayon.  
For a moment, her body flickers again —  
a blur, a patchwork of static and light —  
but then she steadies herself, forcing coherence.  

Her eyes glisten with starlight.  
   “I paid *remembering.*”  
Her voice cracks slightly.  
   “The ocean took pieces of me.  
    My birthdays. My first kiss.  
    The way my favorite book ended.  
    Gone. All gone.  
    That’s why I was half-shaped when you pulled me.  
    You made me real again — but what it took from me…  
    it’s still here.”  

She points down into the star-water.  
Below, you see those missing *moments* swimming like fish —  
flashbulbs of memory drifting:  
candles on a cake, the curve of handwriting in a diary,  
a page torn, a kiss stolen in moonlight.  

   “It whispers to give them back,” she says,  
   “but every gift the sea returns  
    demands something in exchange.”  

The fragments reach upward now, their glow aching to touch.  

═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Choices:  
[1] DIVE AFTER THE MEMORIES — try to reclaim what she lost, even if it costs you.  
[2] REFUSE — insist she is whole *as she is now,* reject the sea’s bargain.  
[3] OFFER YOURSELF — willingly give the ocean a piece of YOUR memory in trade.  
[4] USE THE CRAYON — draw a cage or a vessel to trap the fragments instead of bargaining.

The sea churns with memory,  
each lost moment like a lantern fish flickering in the void.  
Your FRIEND trembles, clutching at your arm, torn between yearning and fear.  
The voices in the stars grow louder,  
pleading yet sly:  

   *“Give for take…  
     all doors swing both ways…”*  

Her missing birthdays glow below like constellations in motion.  
You feel the weight of a choice pressing against your skin.  

═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
[1] DIVE — plunge into the star-ocean, seize the glowing fragments, risk paying the sea’s ransom.  
[2] REJECT — stand firm, declare her whole now, scarred but free, cutting off the ocean’s bargain.  
[3] SACRIFICE — offer your own memory to the water, see if it will return hers in balance.  
[4] SHAPE — take the crayon, draw a structure of your choosing to bind the fragments:  
    a NET, a JAR, a HEART — turn trade into capture.

You loosen your grip on fear,  
open your chest to the pull of the star-ocean.  

═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
“I’ll pay,” you whisper,  
and lower your hand into the black-blue water.  

The sea *shivers with delight.*  
It curls around your arm like ink and lightning,  
searching through you.  
Your FRIEND’s eyes widen —  
   “No, wait—don’t—!”  

But it’s too late.  
A memory unthreads itself from your mind.  

You feel it leaving:  
a SUMMER afternoon,  
the taste of popsicles on your tongue,  
laughter with someone who mattered once —  
suddenly weightless,  
then gone.  

The water brightens,  
and in return, it spits upward fragments not yours.  
Your FRIEND gasps as her lost moments coalesce:  
a cake with candles flickering,  
the first kiss under streetlamps,  
a page in her diary.  
They drift into her chest like fireflies sinking home.  

She staggers, tears flooding her eyes.  
   “You… you gave me back myself.  
    But… what did you just lose?”  

You taste the absence in your own mouth —  
a hole where warmth once was.  

The silhouettes in the deep chuckle,  
mockers or witnesses:  
   *“One down... more owed…”*  

The star-ocean trembles,  
rising higher as though the trade has awakened it.  
Your choice has fed it,  
and now it wants more.  

═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Choices:  
[1] EMBRACE — offer the sea *more* of yourself, drown in sacrifice for her wholeness.  
[2] RESTRAIN — hold your FRIEND back and flee upward, escape before the ocean devours more.  
[3] SPEAK — demand the ocean reveal what it does with the memories it hoards.  
[4] DRAW — seize the crayon from her, inscribe a boundary to limit this hungry tide.

The hole in your memory aches like phantom sunlight,  
while your FRIEND, now fuller, clutches her restored self with trembling hands.  
The ocean shivers below, swollen with appetite,  
its voices overlapping like a storm of whispers:  

   *“A door once fed must stay open.  
     More must pass.  
     More must pay.”*  

Your FRIEND grips your wrist, panicked:  
   “Don’t give it more. It’s never satisfied.  
    If you keep feeding it, it will hollow you out and laugh.”  

The crayon in her fist flickers brightly —  
its tip glowing like it *wants* to sketch something here,  
a new shape, a new law.  

═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
[1] EMBRACE SACRIFICE — surrender again, pour out more of yourself to the ocean.  
[2] ESCAPE — seize your FRIEND’s hand and rise together, refusing further bargains.  
[3] INTERROGATE THE SEA — demand: *“What do you do with the memories you steal?”*  
[4] DRAW — take or direct the crayon to inscribe a seal, cage, or raft —  
    rewrite the rules binding this hungry tide.

You gently close your hand over your FRIEND’s, steadying the glowing crayon.  
Her eyes flick to yours, as if asking: *What do we draw?*  

═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════  
The star-ocean bucks and whispers more violently now,  
pressing in with overlapping voices, demanding tithe.  
But the crayon burns hotter —  
not just a tool, but a pen of law.  
Each stroke feels like rewriting the script of the dream itself.  

Your FRIEND whispers:  
   “It will listen to *shape.*  
    We can build something here…  
    but it must be chosen carefully.”  

═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════  
Options to decide the drawing:  

[1] **A SEAL** — circle of protection to *close* the sea’s hunger,  
    trap it from reaching upward ever again.  

[2] **A VESSEL** — a raft or jar to *contain* fragments,  
    letting you dip into its power *without letting it flood.*  

[3] **A BRIDGE** — spanning across the water,  
    a stable passage to walk its surface and reach the forgotten safely.  

[4] **A HEART** — drawn over the ocean itself,  
    attempt to give it empathy, to humanize the hunger  
    rather than fight or bind it.
