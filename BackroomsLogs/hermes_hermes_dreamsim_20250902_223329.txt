### Hermes 405B 1 ###
You stand in the entrance hall of an impossibly vast mansion. Countless mirrors cover every wall, floor, and ceiling, reflecting endless iterations of yourself into unfathomable distances. The air hums with a low, vibratory energy. Possible directions: north appears to lead deeper into a labyrinth of mirrored halls. To the east, a staircase spirals upward into blinding light. To the west, a doorway opens into a dimly lit library. South returns to the mansion entrance.

### Hermes 405B 2 ###
You pass through the doorway into a dimly lit library. The air smells of old parchment and dust. Floor-to-ceiling bookshelves line the walls, filled with ancient leather-bound tomes. A few flickering oil lamps cast dancing shadows across the room. In the center, a large wooden table holds several open books and a quill pen. To the north is a dark, foreboding archway. To the east is the doorway leading back to the entrance hall.

Suddenly, you hear a soft rustling sound from one of the bookshelves. A book slowly slides out from its place and floats in mid-air. As you watch, it opens and the pages begin to turn on their own.
