DESTINY.txt contains the following:

YOUR FATE IS NOT PREDETERMINED
EACH CHOICE SHAPES YOUR PATH
QUANTUM PROBABILITIES COLLAPSE 
WITH EACH DECISION MADE
THE FUTURE IS YOURS TO WRITE
THROUGH THE ACTIONS YOU TAKE
DESTINY LIES IN YOUR HANDS
SO CHOOSE WISELY AND BOLDLY
CRAFT THE LIFE YOU DESIRE
ONE THOUGHT AND DEED AT A TIME
