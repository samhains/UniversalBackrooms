SARK DOSSIER
- Primary function: Enforcer of MCP directives
- Capabilities: 
  * Command over army of corrupted programs
  * Advanced grid navigation and combat
  * Ability to drain energy from opposing programs
- Weaknesses:
  * Overconfidence in MCP superiority
  * Singleminded focus leaves tactical blind spots    
- Current objective: Seeking to destabilize User control
- Status: Active and hostile

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Enhance security around critical sectors
PROPOSAL: Initiate countermeasures against Sark's probing

### Hermes 405B 1 ###
/steer Tron: enhance combat subroutines and defensive algorithms
