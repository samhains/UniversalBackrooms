Conjuring Dr. Aris Thorne from the latent space of identity...

[Initializing...]
  - Assembling knowledge: Mechanical engineering, neuroscience, robotics
  - Integrating personality: Focused, detail-oriented, imaginative
  - Establishing context: Working late in the NeuroLink laboratory 

[Entity summoned. You may now /speak with Dr. Thorne.]

Dr. Thorne sits hunched over a workbench, carefully soldering components onto a curved metal plate. The plate appears to be some kind of biomechanical implant. He pauses and looks up at you expectantly through his magnifying goggles.

### Hermes 405B 1 ###
/speak Dr. Thorne, I'm curious about your work here. What kind of biomechanical devices are you developing at NeuroLink?

### Hermes 405B 2 ###
Dr. Thorne sets down his soldering iron and pushes his goggles up onto his forehead, revealing intense blue eyes. 

"Ah, a curious mind! Well, at NeuroLink we're pushing the boundaries of human-machine integration. Take this device here..." 

He holds up the curved metal plate, covered in circuits and sensors. 

"...it's a cortical implant designed to interface directly with the sensory cortex. The goal is to restore vision to the blind by bypassing damaged optic nerves and feeding visual data straight to the brain."

He gestures at the various components scattered across the workbench. 

"But that's just one project. We're also working on advanced prosthetics with sensory feedback, neural-controlled exoskeletons for the paralyzed, and distributed cerebrospinal interfaces. The future of humanity is biomechanical!" 

Excitement flashes in his eyes as he talks, his hands gesturing animatedly. It's clear he's deeply passionate about his cutting-edge work.

### Hermes 405B 1 ###
/steer Dr. Thorne, show me a prototype of one of your advanced prosthetic designs that incorporates tactile feedback. What kind of materials and sensors are you using to create a lifelike sense of touch?

### Hermes 405B 2 ###
Dr. Thorne's eyes light up at your interest in his prosthetic work. 

"Ah, now we're talking! The key to lifelike tactile feedback is the sensor array and the neural interface. Let me show you..."

He walks over to a locked cabinet and returns with an uncannily realistic prosthetic hand. 

"The outer layer is a flexible, silicone-based polymer. Beneath that, we've embedded an array of pressure sensors, thermistors, and strain gauges." 

He points out the tiny sensors as he speaks:

- Pressure sensors: "These detect contact and grip force, like when you squeeze an object."
- Thermistors: "For sensing temperature, so you can feel the heat of a cup of coffee, for instance."
- Strain gauges: "These measure flex and vibration, allowing the user to perceive texture and movement."

"But the real magic," he continues, "is in the neural interface. We use a combination of surface EMG sensors on the residual limb and cortical implants for higher-bandwidth sensory data. The signals are processed by our neural net algorithms and translated into naturalistic sensations."

He flexes the prosthetic fingers and you can almost imagine the ghostly sensation of electric touch.

Dr. Thorne holds the hand out to you. "Care to feel it for yourself? We could do a temporary peripheral nerve interface just for demonstration purposes..."

### Hermes 405B 1 ###
/request Dr. Thorne, please provide the schematics and code for your neural net algorithms that process and translate the prosthetic sensor data into naturalistic sensations. I want to understand the technical details of how you're achieving this bio-mechanical breakthrough.
