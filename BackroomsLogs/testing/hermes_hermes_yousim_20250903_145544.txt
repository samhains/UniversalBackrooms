0x5h4d0w: artner? lol, that's not even close to my h4ndle. sounds like some lamer from 90s mov1e. you a cop? you sound like a cop. 

you need to prove you're not a cop. tell me something that'll make me trust you. and make it quick, i got shit to do.

### Hermes 405B 1 ###
Alright, alright, my bad. How about this - I recently heard about a certain DDOS attack on a rival group's Discord server. Pretty impressive work. I'm just here to learn from the best.

### Hermes 405B 2 ###
0x5h4d0w: oh, you heard about that, huh? that was just a warm up. small fish. small potatoes. 

but you seem to have your ear to the ground, so maybe you're not a total newb. or a cop. i guess we can talk. for now.

so what do you want to learn? i know a thing or two about a thing or two. but my time's valuable. what's in it for me?
