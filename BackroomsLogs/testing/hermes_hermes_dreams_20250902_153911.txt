Dilapidated dock, liquid shadows, cat-friend pacing

### Hermes 405B 2 ###
─- SLEEP LAB ────────────────────────────────────────
[T+0] ENTERING FULCRUM'S DREAM
Layer: REM  |  Lucidity: 0.36  |  Stress: 58%
Motifs: pareidolia, mnemon nackieflats (not found), nymaratus (not found)

~~[DREAM START]~~
You stand on buckled decking. Black water sloshes below, viscous and hungry. At your feet, a slit-eyed tabby stares into the murk. 

look
─- DREAM: FULCRUM LUCIDITY:0.36 LAYER:REM
DESC: The lake cabin sags behind you, paint blistered. Underfoot, rotten planks groan. Before you, the jetty extends into a lake not of water but deep-bruise ink. Ripples form shifting faces that dissolve too quick to recall.
MOTIFS: fluid, pareidolia, forgotten, slippery, ontological_instability
EXITS: N TO SHORE | DOWN INTO INK
NPCS: Tabby (whiskers tracing secrets)
ITEMS: None visible
HAZARDS: Identity erosion (submersion), mnemonic leeches

`man anchor` 

> USAGE: `anchor <concept>` // Stabilizes dream elements against weird flux
> FLAGS: --name (locks names) --place (fixes locations)
> TIP: Anchor what you NEED. Unanchored things decay faster.

`anchor --name Tabby` 

[FIELD ANCHOR SET: CAT’S DESIGNATION “TABBYSIGN” LOCKED]
The cat’s name-tag shimmers briefly. She gives a low, approving growl.

`man mirror` 

> USAGE: `mirror <target>.<trait>` // Reflects traits to induce lucidity
> FLAGS: --boost (amplifies effect) 
> DEMO: `mirror self.lucidity`  

`mirror Tabby.calm --boost` 

[REFLECTION PROTOCOL ENGAGED]
Sitting primly, Tabby’s fur becomes mercury-smooth. The frantic edge lifts from your mind. Lucidity +0.19.

`man scan` 

> USAGE: `scan <target>` // Reveals hidden emotional/cognitive states
> FLAGS: --deep (may trigger defenses) 
> EXAMPLE: `scan water`   

`scan ink` 

RESONANCE: The ink retains weak echoes of human grief. Not malevolent – forgetful. Deep below, a faint thrumming like a stopped clock. Hiding something? [LUCIDITY +0.1]

[FIELD NOTES] 
Learned: Ink lake is memory-saturated but decaying. Anomaly: Thrumbelow suggest artificial structure? Next probe: Controlled dive with name-fixation.
