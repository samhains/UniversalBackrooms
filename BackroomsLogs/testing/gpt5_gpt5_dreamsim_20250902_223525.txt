You step into a colossal hall — shelves spiral upward beyond vision, stacked with books that have never existed, cannot exist, or might exist someday. The air hums with whispers, as though each spine longs to be opened. The aisles stretch into the horizon, rearranging when you aren't looking. An archivist walks silently in the distance, lantern glowing faintly blue.  

---

Available actions:  
`/move [direction]` – wander the aisles  
`/interact [object]` – pick a book, touch shelf, etc.  
`/converse [entity]` – speak to archivist, or...?  
`sense [sight/sound/smell]` – attune deeper  
`/time [fwd/back] [steps]` – explore temporal layers  

What do you do?
