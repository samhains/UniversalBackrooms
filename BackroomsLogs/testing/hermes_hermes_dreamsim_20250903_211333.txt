You are hovering in a void, stars swirling around you in distant galaxies. Before you hangs a glowing terminal showing available dreams:

[DREAM 0x1F: Crystalline City of Aeon]
A city of shimmering geometric buildings that shift and reform. Sky-trains of light connect floating districts. Below, rivers of liquid crystal flow.

[DREAM 0x2A: Mutant Bio-Lab]
A secret underground laboratory where illegal gene-splicing experiments have been conducted. Containment units hold bizarre creatures.

[DREAM 0x3C: Titanic Space Derelict]
A massive ancient spaceship drifts in the void, its hull scarred by battle. Inside, darkness and echoes of lives lost.

[DREAM 0x4D: Sentient Forest of Whispers]
A forest where trees have faces and voices. They sing of ancient history and forgotten lore, but some have turned dark and predatory.

[DREAM 0x5E: Clockwork Undercity]
Below a Neon-noir city lies a mechanical wonderland of gears, steam pipes, and clockwork automatons who believe they're alive.
