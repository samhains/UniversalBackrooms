### Hermes 405B 1 ###
You stand in the dusty, sun-baked Athenian Agora circa 428 BCE. The air shimmers with heat as citizens in simple chitons move between the grand temples and civic buildings. The Parthenon gleams on the Acropolis above you. 

A young boy chases a rolling apple that bumps against your feet. An old man argues passionately about governance nearby. The smells of roasting meat, incense, and hot stone fill your nostrils.

### Hermes 405B 2 ###
You bend down and pick up the smooth, warm apple, its skin flushed with red and green streaks. 

The young boy runs up, breathless and dirty-kneed, eyes wide as he sees his prize in your hand. "My apple! Please, kind stranger, that's for my mother's offering at the Thesmophoria!"

"Of course," you say, handing over the apple with a smile. "Where is your mother now?"

The boy accepts the apple reverently. "She's preparing with the other women for tomorrow's fertility rites. She promised to make apple tarts if I helped her fetch supplies!"

He takes a step closer, lowering his voice conspiratorially. "Father says Pericles himself will speak before the Assembly today about the war in Sparta. Will you be attending? I plan to climb the olive trees to watch!"

<cmd>/converse boy: "You have quite the adventurous spirit! What's your name?"

### Hermes 405B 2 ###
"I'm called Aeschylus!" he declares proudly, puffing out his skinny chest. "After the great playwright! Father says I'll write tragedies to make all Hellas weep." 

He kicks at a pebble. "Though I'd rather be a soldier. Or maybe a general! Leonidas wouldn't have lost at Thermopolly if I were there. I'd cut the Persians down like stalks of wheat!" 

Aeschylus mimes stabbing motions, his face screwed up in ferocious concentration.

### Hermes 405B 1 ###
As you converse with young Aeschylus, a shadow passes over the sun. You both look up to see dark clouds gathering over the Acropolis, casting the bustling Agora into premature twilight.

A cold wind whips through the square, stirring up clouds of dust that sting your eyes. The bright, warm day gives way to an eerie, unnatural gloom that makes Aeschylus shiver and move closer to you.
