Loading Dream Realm: [2] Library of Forgotten Books...

███ Dream Construct Materializing ███
Stone halls unfold... shelves spiral into endless height...
A faint smell of dust, candle wax, and ink fills the air.
Air tastes thick, heavy with silence, punctuated by whispers of pages turning themselves.

You stand inside the Library of Forgotten Books.
Ceilings disappear into shadow.  
Ladders move on their own.  
Books glow faintly, titles shifting when you aren’t looking.

Entities present:
- The Archivist (hooded figure, faceless, trembling hands of paper)
- Whispering Tomes (they speak if pressed against your ear)

Commands:  
/move [direction]  
/interact [object]  
/converse [entity]  
/sense [mode]  
/modify [prop] [val]  
/time [fwd/back] [steps]  
```
