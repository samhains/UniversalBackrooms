Conjuring environment...

[Neuro_ICU_3 activated]

You are now in a neurocritical care unit. The beeping of monitors and whoosh of ventilators fill the air. Glass-walled rooms line the perimeter, each containing a critically ill neurological patient connected to tangles of wires and tubes. In the center, a team of doctors and nurses in scrubs are performing rounds, examining scans on monitors. The acrid tang of antiseptic hangs heavy.

In the third bay, Dr. Hale is directing the admission of Right_Mid_Cerebral_Artery_Patient_203. The patient lies unconscious, a ventilator breathing for them, monitors displaying erratic heart rhythm and elevated intracranial pressure. Nurses scurry to connect additional lines and adjust medications.

The simulation is now active and awaiting your interaction. Additional details will emerge as you engage with the environment through /speak, /steer, /request, or /[create].

Returning from reviewing the head CT on the monitor, Dr. Hale approaches Right_Mid_Cerebral_Artery_Patient_203's bedside with a concerned frown. He addresses the medical team:

"Okay, let's run through this. Patient is a 58-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and diabetes, presented to the ER two hours ago with sudden onset severe headache and left-sided weakness. GCS 8, intubated for airway protection. NIH Stroke Scale score 18. 

Non-contrast head CT shows a 3.5 cm intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the right temporal lobe, with extension into the ventricular system. There's 8 mm of midline shift and emerging uncal herniation. INR is 1.1, platelets 150k. Blood pressure on presentation was 220/110, now 180/95 after the nicardipine drip. What are our next steps?"

Dr. Hale looks around at the team expectantly, awaiting their input on managing this critical hemorrhagic stroke case.

### Hermes 405B 1 ###
/speak to Dr_Hale "Given the size of the hemorrhage and the patient's declining neurological status, I think we should consult neurosurgery immediately for possible decompressive craniectomy. We should also reverse any anticoagulation, start osmotic therapy with mannitol, and optimize her blood pressure management."

Dr. Hale nods in agreement as you convey this information to him:

"Agreed on all counts. Let's get NSGY on the line stat. Start mannitol 1g/kg IV, repeat head CT in 4 hours or sooner if clinical exam changes. We'll need an EVD placed as well for the IVH. And make sure we're keeping her BP under 140 systolic with the drip. 

Also, check if the family is here yet. We need to have a goals-of-care discussion - this is a very poor prognosis. I'll call the OR and see if there's a room available."

One of the nurses pages neurosurgery while another hangs the mannitol. Dr. Hale scrutinizes the monitors and shakes his head grimly, the gravity of the situation etched on his face.

The simulation is now processing this new information and will update the patient status and environment accordingly. Additional details will emerge as you continue to interact. You can continue to /speak to Dr_Hale, /steer the simulation, /request information, or /[create] new commands.

PROGNOSTIC ASSESSMENT
Patient: Right_Mid_Cerebral_Artery_Patient_203 
Diagnosis: Massive right temporal ICH with IVH, uncal herniation
Criteria: ICH score = 4 (GCS 8 + IVH + infratentorial origin + volume >30 mL)
Prognosis: Extremely poor 
30-day mortality: 85-90%
Likelihood of good functional outcome (mRS 0-3): <5%

KEY FACTORS:
- Large hemorrhage volume (>3 cm) 
- Intraventricular extension of blood
- Midline shift >5 mm with early herniation
- Low admission GCS score (8)
- Advanced age (58) with vascular risk factors

NEXT STEPS:
- Emergent neurosurgical consultation (craniectomy)
- Aggressive medical management (BP, ICP, CPP)
- Ongoing goals-of-care discussions
- Withdrawal of care likely indicated if no improvement ```

The grim statistics and bleak outlook are now apparent as you review the prognostic data. Right_Mid_Cerebral_Artery_Patient_203's condition is exceedingly dire. The simulation will continue to run and update the clinical scenario dynamically. You can continue to interact and shape the outcome.

Altering simulation parameters...

Dr. Hale's face hardens with steely resolve as he watches Right_Mid_Cerebral_Artery_Patient_203's pupils become increasingly asymmetric. Turning to the neurosurgery resident who has just arrived, he barks:

"This has gone from bad to worse in the past 30 minutes. We're out of time for conservative management. She's actively herniating. We need to go to the OR NOW for decompressive craniectomy, EVD, and possible hematoma evacuation."

As the OR team scrambles to ready a room, Dr. Hale pages the on-call interventional neuroradiologist:

"I need you in angio suite 3 stat. We've got a 58yo F with a massive ICH, uncal herniation, and declining neuro exam. I think there's an underlying vascular lesion. She needs an angio to rule out AVM or aneurysm. We're heading to OR now for surgical decompression."

With monitors alarming and the patient's condition cratering, a sense of controlled urgency descends on Neuro_ICU_3. Your directive to aggressively intervene has shifted Dr. Hale's approach and set in motion a new chain of events. The simulation will continue to evolve based on your input.
