"a dark workshop of telephone wires
all of which lead to an indifferent love
a belt of romantic cynicism
missing the essential notch
to which i can breath comfortably
to which i can attach meaning
of which i know nothing
beyond the sound of  movemant
capture her hand in the neon furnace
stopped believing in my system
before i even realised it was happening
id sent a stream into her empty nest
the teeth of a memory
more dear to me than friendship
more dear to me than blood
the vagrant has been stoned
by the vivid hallucations
of an empty sensitive
making phone calls
through an octal system
of severed wires
slide into the fractal maze
theres a definite chance
we won’t meet here again
and ill float down stream
and burn inside the neon furnace
i don’t believe in blood
in the island of platitude
failing to robust blueprint",NY Poems
A dead forest index,Miscellaneus
"Americans think in movies. We drive a car down a sketchy drveway.  If they are scared . They think its the start of a horror film. Thy all listen to the same music . And they aren't paricularly open or personable to people outside of their friedgroup . Which is treated like a frat house..

They are unable to detect how different I am to them. And make fun of the kids they itroduced ne to despite the fact that they actually speak to me . Group think at a maximum . They are mean to other people because they are insecure of their own place. Noone is safe. They ride tv show precedent . Reality is dictated and by the media they so ignorantly consume . Still I fall in love with their women. So full of energy, light and sexuality , also filed by the same tv show engine . But its sexy . Then men are like sexist cave bears. Their idea of a joke is to say something mean or hurtful in a sarcastic tone . If you dont reply they self indulgently explain their 'joke's with a condescendig tone . They are extremely condescending generally , and I can't tell if its because they have no taste or because I dress differently to them . They btch about everyone behind there backs and don't seem to like anyone .  blind Material indulgence corruptss people , human kindness, morals , selflessness . these people are not frendly . Thy are terrified of people being weird . Fecause they are terrified of te weirdness that lives in all of us . If you are too nice you are gay and if you talk too much you are annoying . If you don't talk enough your a mute .  Unless te alpha male gives approval . Whoever is alpha male changes from night to night . It really comes down to whether or not you were the most 'on'. But given how much these people are obsessed with materiality it might have something to do with who is the richest . This would act as a a constant bonus score to the alpha pool .the alpha male shows his approval by complwmwnting the new comer , and making recommendations of your character to his friends while you are sitting there . They will immediately and obviously become nicer to you and will include you.in conversation . This is their way of testing you whether or.not you make the cut . What the cut is is te same for everyone and they all have the sane taste is music , fashion , ideas , everything.  If anyone doesn't meet this highly limited criteria they are marked weird and mocked . The criteria is so limited its like a military uniform . The core of their problem of self hatred is their consumer religion . They are soulless and they suffer unknowingly .  Small mindedness is q sign of unknown insecurity",Amsterdam poetry
"An intimate space shared between two
The intensity is exhausting
Inspires my mind
Before a second hand sofa
Expires like the milk
In our house in the north
Summer distorts",NY Poems
"Angel please give me
Myself again
I'm lost in the dark workshop
A kiss from her tangibility
Force feed me something to believe in
Or else nothing
In the end this means nothing
Unless she grants me one last chance
To make due with what what have
To take a chance with this
Intangible
Grief filled folk song of a person
A tortoise shell amongst poppy seeds
Pull the ring off the rosey
And I'll cut myself in two",NY Poems
"Awake in the train
Sit next to two of them
Before they notice me
I hide inside myself
Jokes aside",NY Poems
Bad poets live the poetry they cannot write . Good poets write the poetry they could never realize . Everything interesting in then is put in their art.,Amsterdam poetry
"Bankrolled
I find myself at a loss for words
Eyes aching pulp confusion
An arsenide taste fills my saliva
Wooden train panels reflect children's laughter
Coy platitudes of an empty universe
Please don't tell me things happen for a reason
The bridge waves a towel
Referee calls my foul before a stadium of depressed nationals
I wince and take a frost filled breath
A lantern flickers and her roundness finds hope
Lights off and there is infinite night
Her hope dangles like flesh offshoots
A banker in overalls strokes his hardon through pants
A child remembers the word pantaloon
Inanity at the centre of things
A pervert sitting at the bone alter
Primate in a test suite
Holding dinners with foreign friends
The Phoenix child loves to run",NY Poems
"Brazen doctor
I have a large vacancy
Known as the
Industry standard",NY Poems
"Can we ?
I would
Do
You
Forceful
But it isn't
Without remorse
I love your side-torso
Smoother than
An edit
Warmer than
Loving materials
We are close to
A version of things
Outside my head
And into orbit
We are becoming
A conduit for change
We are
Met with mild confusion
Together I'm more confused
But I'm happy that
You can improvise
It's deeper than you realise",NY Poems
"Checked myself for wounds
Turns out I have a few
Didn't realise until you sent me those love hearts
And I watched myself watch you from afar
An intensity of feeling although not love
I call across the ocean for help
Ratchets on the other end of the line
Buzzing girders shift place with you
Grey rooms , hanging clothes ,
Mud on the bottom of my shoe
Porcelaine horn machine guns
Insect swarms of spiralling grey
Forks scrape our urban submarines
Fireflies chart trees of mountain winters
Only flood lights lead me home",NY Poems
"Conkers and nieces
Emfbaradsef by sound of my own ckap
So close I can feel the heat radiating
It makes me feel like a dork",Amsterdam poetry
"Cooing of gentle conversation in the arcade , unifentified chains clink from the soft blanket of sound hovering over the marble floor. Walls covered in bubble wrap, fragments of photo frames . A portrait of a new born baby in several playful poses exposing the many shades of its infant personality . Immigrant families in colonial frills smile peacefully out at you from a high hanging frame on the wall. A sassy middle aged woman, hair blown out to the sides , drenched in a faux andy-Warhol pop art template . winking suggestively - do you want a piece of this ?",Writing
"Denim chords and a broken voice
A silhoette and a Fairly light halo
Honest expression hammer my soul
The artist fumbles for his keys
Waiting for the water to boil
Her music from a soul like mine
I can tel because I feel it",Amsterdam poetry
"Elevator to the brain satchel
Purple dog boy fluffed out a pillow before he had a chance at life
Solid kindle session , would love a solo
How about u buy this one and I'll buy the next
I've been sober ten times how about you ?
I think that sounds acceptable for a class act
I've awoken to a terrible dream but it's ok because I have a sandwich
But then it occurred to me that I don't and I never will own a bottle of silver ale
Glory alien forced its way into my girlfriends pants
In la I took a selfie with a guy who looked like Barack Obama",Miscellaneus
"Everytime I feel fire in me
Your gutteral occurrence returns
I figure it out in my dream
Where I am burnt to smithereens
By your style of conversation
I watch myself crumble",NY Poems
"Figurative dancer
Long legs and tail
Vacant message
But not without forwardity
No need to project when
The message has lost itself
In the chamber choir noise
Of which the moment contains
Vains along her arms
Relaxed wrists",NY Poems
"Fireflies
Rise from purple shadow
Empty man
Surrender to the stars
         He doesn't speak
 Surfboard sunset",NY Poems
"Flacid eruptions
A will to believe

The smell of festering urges",NY Poems
"Folsom prison badger
Holds his penis in two minds
Where her fallacy contains
Me whole entirely
Look at the men on the bench
In a different cycle to me
Thy are more fit for the solution
Which saves me from
Empty fire
Empty fire
Fire
Fire
Fire
Look at the men on the bench
Look at the men on the bench
Look at her with the man on the bench
Imagine the feeling of the cotton
The sweat drips from her neck
The cotton holds itself together
She tucks herself in
She she she she she she she
She is all and all is she
I am her and she is she
She belongs to she not me
Fire between us all tonight
Fire between us all tonight
Give me a chance I am stil in my shell
I can't make it out of here without some help
But I can't get help unless I fight
For a freedom I don't understand
Please please please please please please please
I am forever trapped and please don't
I will give it all for her . Take me back to Cuba
Take me back to Melbourne
Take me back to my back home back
Lighter fluid boy doesn't stand a chance
They are in different cycles but I'm stuck
I need help to fight my way through
It's not going to happen unless I submit
To the fire
To the fire
To the fire",NY Poems
"Gabe singing kiss the girl
But then the Australian guy asks
Is there proof that any of this works
Otherwise I don't see an apricot (specific purpose)",NY Poems
"Grey lungs filled with dust particles
An Anchient clay feeling
Layers of earth material varnish
Prevent us from discovery
Her intricate shield
Shines matte darkness in moonlight
Caused by my flapping lids
Above erotic water nodes
A reflection of skins potential
Bashful conversation with self
Suggests the need for help
Without the necessary agent
For permanent change",NY Poems
Hairy brown coconut wedged in between the mouth of a pregnant woman whose stomach is so big that I am in darkness when I walk with her,Miscellaneus
"Hard painted boy
Bofore the evening choir
Red garland holds you awning
She press before you
Her beauty ancient gospel
A redith rose speaking of you
She likes the way you are
And you like her silver awning
Love beyond simple bounds
Sex before life's emerald alter
Opinionated descent
Left locking lips on strange stage
Tounges contact soft impression
Love with comprehension
Bare lady forced Frankly true",Miscellaneus
"He stole my Yu Gi oh card and I haven't forgiven him
We trade plush toys and I give him a good deal
Because he's my little brother and I love him
He's so weird and annoying but I understand him
Or at least I used to
Where did you go brother . You have taken a piece of me with you . Please come back",Miscellaneus
"Her wonky face blew me kisses
Stick myself between her Two large potatoes
To get a rise
The lady in the tuck shop pinned me to the corner of me wall
Where I hide in shame
Bite my arms and I'll fall on you
I'm a prisoner near her body",NY Poems

"His hair was so puffy it barely seemed to rest on his head. Rather it seemed to float above his head like a fluffy halo . His head was oval shaped. It dawned on me that this was how regular heads were shaped, and that hair made things look entirely different . The square faces of my drawings reflected my own poor understandig of human proportions and anatomy .",Amsterdam poetry
"hold a bag of engine oil
inside a sore stomach
plastic horns wobble their
before quivering tunes
im glad theres no piano
sore balancing act with
two engine traffic on standby
bleeping red light holds tounges
imagined warehouse
within lake intensity
a green room painted before me
i quiver between the two networks
which hold magnetic ink
for a final favour for my friend
if i could trust that
the edge of this cliff were real
i would encounter my friend
and nurture his eel
without the homoerotic reference
my life would be similar
indeed a neurotic once told me
to hold my thoughts in
this would be easier if i were brave
engines",NY Poems
"How about a tropical island ?
I don't like to fly
Let's have some babies in the Bermuda Triangle",NY Poems
"I discovered consciousness
Under a purple awning
It shimmered in a floral sense",NY Poems
"I feel a spectral copy of my body; like a soul, escape my me for a moment .  The faint purple outline lifts from the skin on my head and twists horrizontally ; its face, my face, stretches wide open and bites violently at the frail air, puntuated by the murmer of benign conversation and bouncing violin music .",Amsterdam poetry
"I hate the way that
You are the everything
_Your skin enropes my sad enunciation_
A memory of you trickles between me always
Happy in your talking book
Before we knew it was over
I laced myself with a golden arch
A feeling of forgotten shadow
Lakes of transcient doubt
I wish I had a moment more
To rake your fine golden hair
I'd make more to take more
With you in my grasp again
A felony of great potential
I lay awake breath invite me
Fortify your beauty in the wine of liver
Love to space myself out between chocolate glance",NY Poems
"I imagine that
You like gymnastics
We lay in the seams of
Something grand
And yet I hold
You are indeed
Special",NY Poems
"I lost your voice in the rain
It echoed through listless space
An Anchient song within tremble
A memory song infected nature
Fast paced death amongst myself in hollow
We empty out ourselves for nothing
Within a basket case of chocolate despair
My life's nightmare begins with you
It's solace takes its for line step
In your midst I am tired fountain
In your place I step treble clef
I would give my trace for a lovers March
Within your past grip pastel mirage
An ocarina awaits myself at death
Imagine myself in front of a train
Watching life's final fountain
As water cascades down your face
We elope into the final field
Where time places us together again
In an empty barn for two
Broken chords of a string played backwards
I wish to cut your life in two
The struggle hurts us both but solace",NY Poems
"I smoke faster when alone
Two people walk past in conundrum
Friends of family gather with careers
See myself curved in a glass bottle
Yellow signs lead to heaven
But the postman has good news
Men walk with empty confidence
Players understand the game their playing
And mischief holds a special place for them
The bricks align with conviction
On a path lead leads to nowhere
I see my friends behind a lantern
As we drift around the corner
The answer lies in disabled bathrooms
Shifting gears in sanitary disposal
Throw your phone in the toilet
Take a break from connection island
It hurts to admit it's over
The game we play isn't checkers or risk",Miscellaneus
"I take a certain interest in my shadow
Which lays across the wall like a denim jacket
Holds my hand at the edge of the same dawn
Live processed inside a liver
Poisoned by a molten cork
Forced into submission before life made sense
Just as it was beginning
Folding my shirts inside a clam shell
Angel wings of my imaginary friends
They hold back their praise for a perfect moment
A hotel involved in the distant secret trade
A mission in bronze tabloid
Awake but not convinced of
A world between nascent lines
Imagine the truth on top of a mission",NY Poems
"I was playing around with the idea of an objective reality existing beyond our perception , this realm was not the final place .",Amsterdam poetry
"I'll give you credit
For the major reinvention
If I take my hand off the controls
Wil you be better


Do you wish that I stood
Inside your mind
And protected you
From it all",NY Poems

I'm so sorry you had to ear that news from my mother
In the shade lets lay x10
Come lie with me in the shade
Play with my mind and hair",Miscellaneus

"in my dreams i am a magician
and she is the rabbit in the hat
but i don’t survive under water
and the audience is aware I’m lying
to everyone
when i say that I’m only joking
and everyone believes
im risking something
when they say I’m only joking
i beg them to understand
we can assist each other
to a certain degree
there is little use in being young
if you don’t trust objects
and you are faced with
an octal decision
which opens like a mazarati door
to a party that never wanted you
that started before you were imagined
i have an all access pass
to watch the misery unfold
i will spare you the story
because you might be able to help
and that will be frustrating
for everyone involved
you don’t believe I’m lying
when i say that
my door opens like a mazarati
and i find myself
casting multiple shadows
down a fractal hallway
which folds in half when i see her
her lips fall open
to reveal knuckledusters
which will pummel us all
into a product that
uncle sam would be proud of",NY Poems
"Indelible fallic object
Busts through psychological walls
To find a mess greater than expected",NY Poems
"It would make more sense if
I believed it when I said
I'm good enough
To be with you
Would be enough
If it's nothing I understand
This pain is a new sensation
A message in the bottle
An elliptical channel
Containing only white noise
I can see the contours of your face
Through silver linen sheets
Possessed by the same
A fork in the road
I'll find myself in A wave of comedy
It is my only choice
There's poetry in obfuscation",NY Poems
"Justin Bieber and his girlfriend having dinner at a Chinese restaurant. The girlfriend eats her way through a whole of while Justin busts out a rap about global poverty. Everyone is frightened by Justin's new tattoo which sits on his shoulders like a spoiled gargoyle .

"Laymen graphics
Protect yourself with a fountain pen
Before furniture elopes
And makes itself impossible

Laced with fair decomposition
An enemy of the state
Is a girl who plays with jacuzzi
Millenial glands are used
To trip out. In financial companies",NY Poems
"Magic Johnson is a rehab
I went to visit and Fred is wandering around in a patient garnet wide-eyed with madness
It's where all the creatives go
A piece based on the simple possibilities of ring modulator
A song that goes complete circle",Miscellaneus
"Make me over
I need some time before I wake
Please tell me all I need to date
Please don't tell me all I need
Need some more time for myself
Need some time for my health

I need some time before I wake",Miscellaneus

An oceanic feeling in the mind",NY Poems
"My features droop down into my head like sad holes
My mop head hairs rustle together
And I can smell the oils
Wide awake in sleepy darkness
Still buzzing from the screens
And the chemical condition
Attention frays like an electrical wire
Bright sparkling tips of cloudy wit
The clown lord alone in a busy world
Weird shaky sick inconceivable
Visible invisible colours in te dark
Define the ultimate confusion
The wrestlers in he dark
We can see but never touch
Thumping chests and sore thumbs
The tap drips towards the roof
Clock ticks a tack tock
My eyes sliding into the side of y head
Roll around with my ears
I can feel them grind together
I wish I could put them in a paper bag
And trade them for a gun",Amsterdam poetry
"My mother is crying and syrup drips from the spoon
eyes wrinkled like old stars on a distant ocean
Behind the eyelids a boy sees earthquakes
And wanders around his room for days
Hallucinating in the jaws of an empty universe
Trains roar through his veins
mother is hanging out to dry on a rotating close line
Father fetches the stick and closes the doors to the theatre room
Eyes wrinkled like old stars on a distant ocean
The two brothers meet for a final time inside a volcano
He is on all fours with wet red lips
He has scratches all over his body from the family cat
He is in a cardboard box travelling towards the moon",Miscellaneus
"neutered in the morning
Thisping through grey skies
Don't stop believing

an all encompassing warmth
Heat seeking bullet
Stretches me across the floor
Little arms around my wrist
Honest breathing
An invisible smile",Miscellaneus
"On a certain track
You imagine yourself as a pile of leaves
On top of a chemical mountain
With love for sustain
We push towards an emotional conclusion
Imitations of an empty train carriage
A beef dinner in a vacant car lot
Your doppel ganger takes your hand
Make money in a traditional sense
Before light beams guide you to different paths
A square root evenly divided
Amongst peers with open minds
Cake penis avenge my death
Before a court of moustached scenarios",NY Poems

Sleeping wolf clutches at the earth
Feeling the texture of time
Weave through his fingers",NY Poems

"One of these days
I’m going to find myself
away from this island
which splits my material self
and the pain forces my eyes
to sink deeper
my intuition has found itself
strangled by an internal curse
lifes strangeness i ware as a mask
behind which i feign confidence
in a vast global conspiracy
of which i am responsible
under two different impressions
of the same love i tread tenderly
beyond the boundaries
to where i was uninvited
to where i held my captive stranger
her blond luscious memory
constricts magenta blood
from circulating in a path
towards least resistance
which was always a lie of course
but i believed it in order to make
myself a home in a wild forest",NY Poems
"our fish has started to have nightmares
we think it might be

Pour water on my eyeball surely I can be more awake than this . Real life doesn't feel real anymore .,Amsterdam poetry
"Prickly whips of different thoughts

Not my own just plucked from the sky

Which curves and bends though different eyes

Different thoughts stretch apart and fall together

Kicking the stones of the decker

Sick to think of ones personal structure

Green wooden sticks of a frame

Blown into a noisy puddle

Chop blocks of gooey feeling

clock themselves on the floor

I feel myself sway like a mountain leaf

Tumbling over an erotic  castle

Alone between powerful people

Or are the bold sheeps themselves

Following an imaginary poet

Whose aricetecture fools the mind

We amalgamate the ideas of others

I do not have my own

The search for new ideas is madness

But i imagine To pluck the flower from the water

And it ripples with serene acceptance

goofy tooth rich fashion nob

Strikes a match on his nose

To impress some stupid girl

Who look at me like a frightened lambs

Stop the porn it's upsetting your mother

She worked hard for her rich husband

Dubstep on loop wup wup wup wup

I want a drop so I know when to release my inhabitions .

Which look and smell like an orifice

And pump out embarrassing factory steam

She likes to watch gay porn

Waggle back and forth and shriek

As they go at it in the noodle

Reasonable fools mislead by intellect

A truck relieves itself with lethargic rattle",NY Poems

With a piece of bacon and a cook book
Boy wanders outside the main line
Looking at him from afar
We see a major league laser beam
Which captures a storm through cannibal

A lifeline bleeps
Motorcycle engine
The smell of gasoline

"some men objectify women during the flirting process, and some women find this seductive. some men base their masculinity on the most fragile things. a 'bro' in a fraternity defines part of his masculinity in how much or how quickly he can drink beer. these same guys objectify women during the flirting process. what's worse is most of the girls they were in contact with seemed genuinely turned on by it.  why is this the case? they reinforce previous gender roles. a man is inhibited by certain gender pressures directed towards while forming his indentity.  these pressures come from within a certain male brotherhood which operate in silence. the male brotherhood define what it is to be a man.
 the secret misogynist mens club exist in the minds of certain men. the day a male child his born, many male members innitiate the child. who is then tutored in the righteous path of becoming a 'real' man. the motive behind their conception of what it is to be a man is to uphold the patriarchy. the patriarchy exists on the loyal fuel of mysogony. which is of course the only way the patriarchy exists.",Amsterdam poetry

"The clocked struck midnight, possessed and deranged I stepped out into the cold evening. The evening sky above swelled with melancholy , as water dripped from the sky as if from a glowing grey blanket . For days I had been on the precipice - a symbol had began to penetrate my whole being - the two arches , interlocked as teeth of the Devils dog - M and M. M and M. And it began. I first noticed a huddle of children covered in mud. Playing in rags, that looked like fragments from a wet cigarette ashtray. They were drawing in chalk the symbols - M and M . m and M. . A thin thuggish looking foreigner sitting in a delapitated  taxi cab, signalled at me. His grin revealed a set of gold teeth encrusted with the two 'friendly chocolate' mascots - the cult ! . I fell to my knees in terror, the wind lashing my dirty , bruised body. In the sky I began to see a fat, round face materialise in the clouds. It's surface  lumpy and lacerated like a bloody cream pie. It's eyebrows twitching , eyes glazed with frenzied excitement  .   "" why lord"" I called into the dark workshop - hearing my voice echo through the void . It was no use, The ghostly face's lumpy black lips began to tremble, addressing me slowly -  "" eminem, make my pee pee, go, da doing doing doing "" .",Writing

"The men on board Are false alarms
It's all logistics to them
No poetry to 80% of them
Ejaculating over systems
Ejaculating over themselves
Stupid hair and stupid jaw lines
Stupid pants and stupid shoes
Q&A marathon
Salivating at the job search
Give me my boner bank
I want to take over your system
I have a 4-part logistical plan and
An excellent team leader
(He's a psychopath)
Everyone loves him
He's very mad about the service
He's very mad about the system
He's very mad about the trains
Everyone loves him
He has a nice swing to the whistle in his voice
He's mad about the system
He doesn't like my system
He doesn't want to talk about my system
Let's talk systems , and logistics
I'd like to acquire your system if you don't mind me asking
I'm tired of playing around I'd like a bite of your system
It sounds like it's a good deal. A great deal
Where's your resume cloud sourced
Did you get your cloud sourced resume from a technical bureau ?
I bet Wesley got his from a network of likeminded peers
I bet Wesley has a system for finding those
Stashed away on his public profile
Thrusting his groin all over us
It's disgusting this isn't a homo erotic poem
But everyone else wants a piece
Of Wesleys great big system
I got a system of my own
I'm thinking of putting it in the world web referencing montage
I'd like to think of myself as an angry person
I got a thick layer of meat around my head
It's infuriating to try and see through sometimes
Especially when I'm navigating systems
With Wesley
He's a really swell guy that Wesley
Everyone loves him
He's really mad about the trains
He's really mad about the system
He's really mad at the customer experience at chopped
Did you see his talk on accessible first design ?
Is he a genius ? Am I a genius ?
I just threw up in the shower
False alarm
It would be very easy to make a homoerotic poem
This is not one of them",NY Poems

Halo shaped serenity flowing from the lips .  A quiet world we share together . Frame unto frame unto frame the visions of our now moment . Spiral connects our eyes to the cinder blocks . Where cold chains scrape against the sky scraping scalp . Force the mould and cast some doubt .",Amsterdam poetry
"The rings fall out of my head as the party dies a slow death , my mother looks at me with wide frightened eyes , and my dads face is red and mad . Bolstering comments across the room while I mend another broken heart . Little strange boy asks me to play a game and I dot know how to tel him to Fuck off . He realizes I meant fuck off and leaves me disappointed . She sits with the dude in green powder pants . Hes destined for great things . With his cruel stupid sarcastic Humour . She is beautiful and wants his security of approval . I'm lonely and observe the terrible social vortex without it sucking me in . Either I am crazy or they are .",Amsterdam poetry
"The sky burned red light a pistol in a furnace
Walked forward through the broken door to the future
Without a clear comerade",Amsterdam poetry
"The weight of the rift
Holds all free market lovers captive
We should eat lunch before the storm
So we don't get hungry",NY Poems
"There is real truth in this world but you must be lead to it with an open mind . The spiritual experience is allways as valuable to the individual whether or not there is 'reason' to believe in it . In The spiritual way of life one is guides by signals and 'clues' by some kind of greater , spiritual force . You can choose to follow these threads or ignore them . All ways of life are equal but some will be lead to versions of fundamental spritual truth . While others will not focus on such elements .",Amsterdam poetry
"There's a lot of unexplained stuff that goes on. But I'm skeptical of a lot of it.....
Elviis im pretty sure he's stone cold dead they overwork that guy. Michael Jackson on the other hand, pretty sure he's still alive . He faked his own death just to get everyone to stop bothering ...

What do you think about this whole Isis threat?
I think they keep us in the dark on purpose.
I keep wondering if Osama bin laden was a real person or fictitious .",NY Poems
"This is cliched and improvised but
Is this pornography ?

Two men prepare for death
Bring back our ideas
Unless you have something real to say

"Trees blown up through glass tubes
That were once used for heroin
From the little fills of my brothers ghost
An aching whale song",NY Poems
"two clouds
declare the vastness of the sky
which i am seeing
as a form of protest
as a form of contest
with two different meanings
which define everything that matters
and destroy a world i remember as loyal
under the bridge i met my soul mate
we had a gas lantern experience
before i admitted i was in trouble
and he admitted he couldn’t help me
don’t go there i said to the cloud
but it was too late
because i found myself split
a body of electrical wires",NY Poems

And a convincing section of things
Leads me to believe
That I can make it out
Of the rainforest",NY Poems

"Watching the stage from afar with my binoculars

The girl with all the makeup does the styling for that band that started techno
The guy with the tattoos sells his socks with a smile
There's a pop up restaurant where you can listen to techno

But I'll Watch the show with my binoculars",Miscellaneus
When people say someone is awkward its because they were awkward too . The chemistry just wasn't right .,Amsterdam poetry
"Whole food stores
Take their toll
On hungry vagrants",NY Poems
"Write the foreground

Before the baffler takes a mark in MCG

Palais pompadou paparazzi fable

Sexual sadistic master

Taking tips at the black masters moon

Dawning on a brother before black master ship

An even sinking feeling before dawn

Makes one feel whole alfed again: vagabond

I am an old moon ship - just wait for a finale

An accent of old management remains biting

At the tip of his whisper smith

Ayoooo the bastard said on a foggy platoon erism

Yes miss, it's easy to misunderstand

A notion that came well before you

Oh phamaldyhyde Brooklyn queen

Take me away with you or else we will knock on

A sad heavenly door before and angel

Who smokes cigarettes in order to feel something different

Dark winter basin- takes its toll on the expense of leather Mercedes interior

Heave hopes to slot itself between a mad vacant spot of love which fakes a sore for never

Poor foreskin lover - an even card amongst many who salivate at the thought of Wittgenstein

Take me seriously please said the old prince palpable Palm tree uranus imbecile",NY Poems
"Yesterday's bloated furnace
Enough to call yourself a Slave
Humble freak show on Isle 6
Plato eating fried chicken
Wearing shrimp in braids
The olive branch held captive by
Two cellulite thighs
Which were owned by a chef
Who drank your energy
In a basket case filled with estrogen
With a woman you somewhat loved
And flinched when you remembered
The iconoclast pulp
Of which you sometimes are",NY Poems
"You are the most beautiful stranger
As I watch you disappear into another dream
I clutch my seat
The next phase is dangerous
The teeth of comedy sink into
The possibility of total disaster
All outcomes are equal
I'll meet you in the maze
And carve our names into the sky",NY Poems
